<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>My book, <i>Young India</i>, was written during the
first year of the war and was finally revised and sent
to the press before the war was two years old. It
concluded with the following observation:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;The Indians are a chivalrous people; they will
not disturb England as long as she is engaged with
Germany. The struggle after the war might, however,
be even more bitter and sustained.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>The events that have happened since have amply
justified the above conclusion. India not only refrained
from disturbing England while she was engaged
in war with Germany, but actively helped in defeating
Germany and winning the war. She raised an army
of over a million combatants and supplied a large
number of war workers, and made huge contributions
in money and materials. She denied herself the necessities
of life in order to feed and equip the armies in
the field though within the last months of the war,
when scarcity and epidemic overtook her, she lost
six millions of her sons and daughters from one disease
alone&mdash;influenza. This was more than chivalry.
This was self-effacement in the interests of an Empire
which, in the past, had treated her children as helots.
How much of this effort was voluntary and how
much of it was forced it is difficult to appraise. Great
Britain, however, has unequivocally accepted it as
voluntary and has attributed it to India&rsquo;s satisfaction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
with her rule. That India was not satisfied with her
rule she has spared no pains to impress upon the
British people as well as the rest of the world. Reading
between the lines of the report of the Secretary of
State for India and the Viceroy has established the
fact of that dissatisfaction beyond the possibility of
doubt, but if any doubt still remained it has been
dispelled by the writings and utterances of her representative
spokesman in India, in Great Britain and
abroad. The prince and the peasant, the landlord and
the ryot, the professor and the student, the politician
and the layman&mdash;all have spoken. They differ
in their estimates of the &ldquo;blessings&rdquo; of British rule,
they differ in the manner of their profession of loyalty
to the British Empire, they sometimes differ in shaping
their schemes for the future Government of India
but they are all agreed:</p>

<p>(1) That the present constitution of the Government
of India is viciously autocratic, bureaucratic,
antiquated and unsatisfying.</p>

<p>(2) That India has, in the past, been governed
more in the interests of, and by the British merchant
and the British aristocrat than in the interests of her
own peoples.</p>

<p>(3) That the neglect of India&rsquo;s education and industries
has been culpably tragic and</p>

<p>(4) That the only real and effectual remedy is to
introduce an element of responsibility in the Government
of India.</p>

<p>In the report of the Secretary of State and the
Viceroy, so often quoted and referred to in these
pages, the truth of (1), (3), and (4) is substantially
admitted and point (2) indirectly conceded. In the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
following pages an attempt is made to prove this
by extracts from the report itself. Ever since the
report was published in July, 1918, India has been in
a state of ferment,&mdash;a ferment of enthusiasm and
criticism, of hope and disappointment. While the
country has freely acknowledged the unique value of
the report, the politicians have differed in their estimates
of the value of the scheme embodied therein.
Yet there is a complete unanimity on one point, that
nothing <i>less</i> than what is planned in the report will
be accepted, even as the first step towards eventual
complete responsible Government. This is the minimum.
Even the ultra-moderates have expressed
themselves quite strongly on that point. Speaking
at the Conference of the Moderates held at Bombay
on November 1, 1918, the President, Mr. Surendranath
Banerjea, is reported to have said: &ldquo;our creed is co-operation
with the Government wherever practicable,
and opposition to its policy and measures when the
supreme interests of the mother-land require it....
I have a word to say ... to the British Government.
I have a warning note to sound.... If the enactment
of the Reform proposals is unduly postponed, if they
are whittled down <i>in any way</i> ... there will be
grave public discontent and agitation.&rdquo; A little
further in the same speech he asked if &ldquo;by the unwisdom
of our rulers&rdquo; India was &ldquo;to be converted
into a greater Ireland.&rdquo; In less than six months
from the date of this pronouncement, the rulers of
India gave ample proof of their &ldquo;unwisdom&rdquo; by
actually converting India into a &ldquo;greater Ireland&rdquo;
and in establishing the absolute correctness of the
prognostication made by the present writer in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
concluding sentence of his book <i>Young India</i>. The
manifesto of the Moderate Party issued over the
signatures of the Moderate leaders all over the country
contained the following warning: &ldquo;We must equally
protest against every attempt, by whomever made
and in whatever manner, at any mutilation of the
Montagu-Chelmsford proposals. We are constrained
to utter a grave warning against the inevitable disastrous
effects of such a grievous mistake on the
future relations of the British Government and the
Indian people which will result in discontent and agitation
followed by repression on the one side and suffering
on the other side.&rdquo; Little did they know when
they uttered the warning that repression would come
even before the Reform Scheme was discussed in
Parliament and &ldquo;mutilated&rdquo; there. British rule in
Ireland has been for the last twenty years a wearisome
record of mixed concessions and coercions. Every
time a concession was made it was either preceded
or accompanied by strong doses of coercion. One
would have thought that British statesmen were wiser
by their experience of Ireland, but it seems that they
have learnt nothing and that they have no intention
of doing in India anything different from what they
have been doing in Ireland. The history of British
statesmanship in relation to Irish affairs is repeating
itself almost item by item in India.</p>

<p>Lord Morley&rsquo;s reforms were both preceded and
followed by strong measures of repression and suppression.
As if to prove that British statesmanship
can never in this respect set aside precedent even for
once, Mr. Montagu&rsquo;s proposals have been followed
by a measure of coercion unique even for India. Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
Montagu&rsquo;s proposals for the reconstruction of Government
in India are yet in the air. They are being
criticised and examined minutely by numerous British
agencies both in India and in England as to how and
in what respects they can be made innocuous. Certain
other reforms promised by the report, such as the
scheme for Local Self Government and the policy
in relation to the Arms Act, have already been disposed
of in the usual masterly way of giving with one
hand and taking back with the other. Similarly the
&ldquo;great&rdquo; scheme of opening the commissioned ranks
of the Army to the native Indians has practically
(for the present at least) ended in fiasco. But the
policy underlying the Rowlatt laws has surpassed all.
In the chapters of this book dealing with the Revolutionary
movement the reader will find a genesis
of the Rowlatt laws of coercion.</p>

<p>On the sixteenth of January in the <i>Gazette of India</i>
was published a draft of two bills that were proposed
to be brought before the Legislative Council of India
(which has a standing majority of Government officials).
These bills were to give effect to the recommendations
of the committee presided over by Mr. Justice
Rowlatt of the High Court of England, for the prevention,
detection and punishment of sedition in India.
Their introduction into the Legislative Council was at
once protested against by all classes of Indians with a
unanimity never before witnessed in the history of
India. All sections of the great Indian population
from the Prince to the peasant, including all races,
religions, sects, castes, creeds and professions joined
in the protest. Hindus, Mohammedans, Indian Christians,
Sikhs, Buddhists, Parsees&mdash;all stood up, to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
man, to oppose the measure. All the political parties,
Conservatives, Liberals, Moderates and Extremists
expressed themselves against it. The measure was
opposed by all the non-official Indian members of the
Legislative Council. All methods of agitation were
resorted to in order to make the opinion of the country
known to the Government and to warn the latter
against the danger of defying the united will of the
people. The press, the pulpit and the platform all
joined in denouncing the measures, meetings of protest
were held in all parts of the country and resolutions
wired to the Government. A few days before the
final meeting at which these bills were to be passed
into law a number of prominent citizens, male and
female, pledged themselves to passive resistance in
case the measures were enacted. The passive resistance
movement was inaugurated and led by Mr.
M. K. Gandhi, a man of saintly character, universally
respected and revered in India, the same who stood
for the Government during the war and rendered
material help in recruiting soldiers, raising loans and
procuring other help for its prosecution. The following
is the text of the pledge that was signed by hundreds
and thousands of Indians belonging to all races and
religions and hailing from all parts of the continent:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Being conscientiously of opinion that the bills
known as the Indian Criminal Law (Amendment)
Bill No. 1 of 1919 and No. 2 of 1919 are unjust, subversive
of the principle of liberty and justice and destructive
of the elementary rights of individuals
on which the safety of the community as a whole
and the State itself is based, we solemnly affirm that,
in the event of these bills becoming law, we shall
refuse civilly to obey these laws and such other laws<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
as a committee to be hereafter appointed may think
fit and we further affirm that in this struggle we will
faithfully follow truth and refrain from violence of
life, person or property.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>The passive resistance movement was not approved
by the country as a whole, and influential voices were
raised against it even in its early stages but the fact
that Mr. Gandhi had taken the responsibility of
initiating and leading it and that many women had
signed the pledge should have opened the eyes of the
Government as to the intensity of the feeling behind
it. Besides this threat of passive resistance the
Indian members of the Council showed their solid
opposition to the measure by using all the historic
obstructive methods so well known to the student of
Parliamentary debates in the House of Commons as
associated with the Irish Nationalist party under the
leadership of Parnell. The debates in the Legislative
Council of India do not ordinarily last for more than
one day, consisting, at the most, of eight hours. The
debate on this bill lasted for three days; one sitting
lasted &ldquo;from 11 o&rsquo;clock in the morning ... until
nearly half past one the following day with adjournments
for luncheon and dinner.&rdquo; The officials were
determined to pass the bill at that sitting and so they
refused to rise until the amendments on the agenda
had been disposed of and the bill passed into law. The
non-officials proposed no less than 160 amendments
but by the application of closure methods they were
all disposed of in three days and the bill passed (on the
18th of March). The Government made a few minor
concessions but on the whole the bill remained as it
had been drafted, a monument of Governmental<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
shortsightedness and stupidity. The consideration of
the other bill was postponed. As soon as the news
reached Bombay that the first bill had become law
&ldquo;the market was closed as a protest&rdquo; and &ldquo;posters
in English and the vernacular, were displayed throughout
the city urging the non-payment of taxes and
asking the people to resist the order of a tyrannical
Government.&rdquo; (London <i>Times</i>, April 2.) Similar
manifestations of anger were made throughout the
country and the movement for passive resistance was
definitely inaugurated. It spread like wild fire.
Thousands joined it and the relations between the
people and the Government became very strained.
However, no violence was resorted to, nor was any
harm done to life and property. Several members of
the Legislative Council resigned their offices. One of
them a Mohammedan leader, wrote the following letter
to His Excellency the Viceroy:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Your Excellency, the passing of the Rowlatt Bill
by the Government of India and the assent given to
it by your Excellency as Governor-General against
the will of the people has severely shaken the trust
reposed by them in British justice. Further, it has
clearly demonstrated the constitution of the Imperial
Legislative Council which is a legislature but in name,
a machine propelled by a foreign executive. Neither
the unanimous opinion of the non-official Indian members,
nor the entire public opinion and feeling outside
has met with the least respect. The Government of
India and your Excellency, however, have thought
it fit to place on the statute-book a measure admittedly
obnoxious and decidedly coercive at a time of peace,
thereby substituting executive for judicial discretion.
Besides, by passing this Bill, your Excellency&rsquo;s Government
have actively negatived every argument they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
advanced but a year ago when they appealed to India
for help at the War Conference, and have ruthlessly
trampled upon the principles for which Great Britain
avowedly fought the war.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fundamental principles of justice have been
uprooted and the constitutional rights of the people
have been violated, at a time when there is no real
danger to the state, by an overfearful and incompetent
bureaucracy which is neither responsible to the people,
nor in touch with real public opinion and their whole
plea is that &lsquo;powers when they are assumed will not be
abused.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I, therefore, as a protest against the passing of the
Bill and the manner in which it was passed, tender
my resignation as a member of the Imperial Legislative
Council, for I feel that, under the prevailing
conditions, I can be of no use to my people in the
Council, nor, consistently with one&rsquo;s self respect, is
co&ouml;peration possible with a Government that shows
such utter disregard for the opinion of the representatives
of the people in the Council Chamber and the
feelings and sentiments of the people outside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In my opinion, a Government that passes or sanctions
such law in times of peace forfeits its claim to be
called a civilized Government and I still hope that
the Secretary of State for India, Mr. Montagu, will
advise his Majesty to signify his disallowance to this
Black Act.</p>

<p class="ralign">
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">&ldquo;Yours truly,</span><br />
&ldquo;M. A. Jinnah.&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>

<p class="noidt">The leaders of the passive resistance movement declared
30th March as &ldquo;the National protest day.&rdquo;
The protest was to be made by all the traditional
methods known to India for ages, viz., by fasting,
stopping business, praying, and meeting in congregations
in their respective places of worship. The
only Western method contemplated was passing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
resolutions and sending telegrams to the authorities
in India and England. The 30th of March was thus
observed as a national protest day throughout India
and there was only one clash between the people and
the Government, viz., at Delhi, the national capital.</p>

<p>Delhi has been the national capital of India from
times immemorial. It was the chief capital city of
the Moguls. It has a mixed population of Hindus
and Mohammedans, almost evenly divided. The
European population there is not very large. There
is a British garrison stationed in the Mogul fort.
Besides being the capital of British India, Delhi is
a very important trade center and the terminus of
several railway lines. All business was stopped,
shops closed and the city gave an appearance of a
general strike. A mass meeting attended by 40,000
people, according to British estimates, and presided
over by a religious ascetic, passed resolutions of protest
and cabled them to the Secretary of State for
India in London. It was at Delhi and on this day as
already stated that the first clash occurred between the
authorities and the people. It is immaterial how it
came about but it may be noted that rifles and machine
guns were freely used in dispersing the mobs at the
railway station and other places. According to
official estimates fourteen persons were killed and
about sixty wounded. The non-official estimates
give larger figures. Evidently nothing serious happened
between March 30th and April 6th which last
was observed as a day of mourning throughout British
India from Peshawar to Cape Comorin and from Calcutta
to Karachi and Bombay. People held meetings,
made speeches, marched in processions, took pledges<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
of passive resistance, closed shops, suspended business,
bathed in the sea, joined in prayer and fasted. No
violence of any kind was reported. In the words of
a correspondent of the London <i>Times</i>, &ldquo;the distinguishing
feature of many of these demonstrations
[meaning thereby passive resistance demonstrations]
made on the 6th of April, specially at Delhi, Agra,
Bombay and Calcutta, is the Hindu and Moslem
fraternization, Hindus being freely admitted to the
mosques, on occasions occupying the Mihrab (the
niche indicating the direction of Mecca).&rdquo; In a
message dated April 7th the same correspondent
cabled &ldquo;an unprecedented event in the shape of a
joint Moslem-Hindu service at the famous Juma
Masjed at Delhi, at which a Hindu<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> delivered a sermon.&rdquo;
The Juma Masjed is one of the jewels of
Mogul architecture and probably the biggest mosque
in India.</p>

<p>On April 9th Sir Michael O&rsquo;Dwyer, the Lieutenant
Governor of the Punjab, dwelt with pride on the fact
that the province ruled by him with an iron hand
for the last five years &ldquo;had raised 360,000 combatants
during the war.&rdquo; &ldquo;Dealing with the political situation
he declared that the Government of the province
was determined that public order which was maintained
during the war, should not be disturbed during
peace. Action had therefore been taken under the
Defence Act against certain individuals who were
openly endeavoring to arouse public feeling against
the Government.&rdquo; It was this action, viz., the sum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>mary
arrest of leaders at Amritsar and the order of
prohibition against Mr. Gandhi&rsquo;s contemplated visit
to the Punjab, that set fire to the accumulated magazine.
It exasperated the people and in a moment
of despair the intense strain of the last few weeks
found relief in attacks on Government buildings and
stray persons of European extraction. What actually
happened in different places no one can definitely
tell just at this stage but it is clear that at places so
widely distant as Amritsar and Lahore in the Punjab
and Viramgam in the Gujerat (Western Presidency)
railway stations, telegraph offices and some other
public buildings were burned, railway traffic interrupted,
tram cars stopped and some Europeans killed
and attacked. At Amritsar three banks were burnt
down and their managers killed. Telegraphing on
April 15th and again on the 16th of April, the correspondent
of the London <i>Times</i> remarked that &ldquo;the
Punjab continued to be the principal seat of trouble&rdquo;
which was probably due to the extremely brutal
methods which the Punjab Government had followed
in repressing and suppressing not only the
present &lsquo;riots&rsquo; but also all kinds of political activity
in the preceding six years. It appears that in about
a week&rsquo;s time almost the whole province was ablaze.
The Government used machine guns in dispersing
meetings, showered bombs from aeroplanes and declared
martial law in several towns, extended the
seditious meetings prevention Act and other emergency
laws in districts, marched flying military columns
from one end to the other, accompanied by travelling
courts martial to try and punish on the spot all arrested
for offences committed in connection with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
passive resistence movement. Leaders were arrested
and deported without trial of any kind; papers were
suppressed and all kinds of demonstrations prohibited.</p>

<p>Among the leaders arrested are the names of some of
the most conservative and moderate of the Punjab public
men&mdash;men whose whole life is opposed to extremism of
any kind. Those men were subjected to various indignities,
handcuffed and marched to jail. They have been
held in ordinary prison cells and all comforts have been
denied to them as if they were criminals. Counsel
engaged for them from outside the Province have been
refused admission into the Province. Machine guns
and aeroplanes have been used in dispersing unarmed
mobs and crowds were fired at in many places. At
Lahore the General Officer Commanding gave notice
&ldquo;that unless all the shops were re-opened within 48
hours all goods in the shops not opened will be sold
by public auction.&rdquo; As to the causes of the upheaval,
the Anglo-Indian view is contained in a telegraphic
message to the London <i>Times</i> bearing date April 20th.
Below we give a verbatim copy of this message:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<h4>CAUSES OF THE UPHEAVAL.</h4>

<p>&ldquo;Bombay, April 20.&mdash;We have passed through
the most anxious ten days that India has known for
half a century. We have further anxious days in
store, for although in Bombay conditions are improving
and Mr. Gandhi has publicly abandoned the passive
resistance movement, while men of weight are rallying
to the support of the Government, the situation in
Northern India is disquieting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We may pause to enquire into this widespread
manifestation of violence. How came it that passive
resistance to the Rowlatt Act&mdash;never likely to be
applied to the greater part of India, especially to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
Bombay, and nominally confined to the sale of proscribed
literature of doubtful legality, which was waning&mdash;suddenly
flamed into riot, arson, and murder
at Delhi, Ahmedabad, Viramgam, Amritsar, and other
parts of the Punjab on the prevention of Mr. Gandhi&rsquo;s
entry into Delhi? All day on April 11 Bombay stood
on the brink of a bloody riot, averted only by the
Governor, Sir George Lloyd&rsquo;s prudent statesmanship
and the great restraint of the police and military in
face of grave provocation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The movement seems to have been twofold. In
part it was the expression of the prevailing ferment.
India is no less affected than other parts of the world
by the social and intellectual revolution of the war,
by expectations based on the destruction of German
materialism and by ambitions for fuller partnership
in the British Empire.</p>


<h4>PROFITEERING AND TRICKERY.</h4>

<p>&ldquo;The disruptive effect of these ideals is accentuated
by prevailing conditions. The prices of food are
exceedingly high, supplies are scanty, while efforts to
control prices are hampered by the profiteering and
trade trickery unfortunately never absent from this
country. [As if it was absent from other countries.]</p>

<p>&ldquo;India having been swept bare of foodstuffs, to
meet the exigencies of the war, the people feel that
the home Government is lukewarm in releasing supplies
from outside, and resent particularly that the
Shipping Controller is maintaining high freights on
fat and rice from Burma. These severe sufferings are
superimposed on the devastating influenza and cholera
epidemics. So much for the social and economic
situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then the activities of the Indo-British Association
created grave doubts whether Parliament will deal
fairly with India when the reform scheme is considered.
The Rowlatt Act was precipitated into this
surcharged atmosphere.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The Act was wickedly perverted by the Extremists
until among the common people it became the general
belief that it gave plenary powers to a police which was
feared and distrusted. Among educated people, few
of whom studied the report or the Act, it was bitterly
resented as a badge of India&rsquo;s subjection after loyal
participation in the war, at a time when the strongest
feeling in the country was craving for its self-respect
in the eyes of the nations. Further, it was regarded
as prejudicing the cause of political reform.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another powerful contributory cause was the
ferment amongst the Moslem community. Everywhere
the Moslems believe that the Peace Conference
is bent on the destruction of Islam. There is no
confidence in British protection after our declared
policy in regard to Turkey and the undoing of the
settled fact in Eastern Bengal in 1911.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This feeling is the more dangerous because it is
inchoate. Moslem officers returned from Palestine
and Arabia, and acquainted with the realities of Turkish
rule, have expressed astonishment at the strength
of this feeling among their co-religionists here. Mohamedans
have been foremost in the work of riot and
destruction in Ahmedabad and Delhi, and the lower
elements were ripe for trouble in Bombay. I am
unable to say how far this ferment affected the outbreaks
in the Punjab.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This seething Moslem unrest is the most menacing
feature of Indian politics to-day. It explains the
unprecedented admission of Hindus to the Mosques
of Delhi and Aligarh....</p>


<h4>REVOLUTIONARY INSPIRATION</h4>

<p>&ldquo;So much for the general situation. In Northern
India the outbreaks were nakedly revolutionary.
They are unconnected with the Rowlatt Act or with
passive resistance, which probably precipitated a
movement long concerted. There is abundant evidence
of the organized revolutionary character of the dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>turbances
in the systematic attacks on railways,
telegraphs, and all means of communication, and its
definitely anti-British character is apparent from the
efforts to plunge the railways into a general strike.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are signs of the inter-connection of the
Punjab revolutionaries with the Bombay revolutionaries
who organized attacks on communications at
Ahmedabad and Viramgam, derailed trains, cut
telegraphs, and sent rowdies from Kaira to take part
in the work of destruction. There is evidence also
of some outside inspiration, but whether Bolshevist
or otherwise is obscure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whilst in the Punjab the soil was fruitful, owing
to economic conditions, the ravages of influenza,
and the pressure of last year&rsquo;s recruiting campaign,
the revolutionary origin of the disturbances is unquestioned....&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>As usual the message is a mixture of truth and
imagination. At most it is a partisan view. Be the
causes what they may, the events in our judgment
amply justify the following conclusions:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) That India is politically united in demanding
a far reaching measure of self-determination.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) That she will not be satisfied with paltry measures
of political reform which do not give her power
to shape her fiscal policy in her own interests, independent
of control from London.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) That it is useless to further harp on the &ldquo;cleavages&rdquo;
of race, religion and language, in dealing with the
problem of India.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) That the country is no longer prepared to let
measures of coercion pass and take effect without
making their protest and dislike known to the authorities
in a manner, the significance of which may not be
open to misunderstanding.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span></p>

<p>The Indian members of the Legislative Council
while opposing the Rowlatt Bills spoke in sufficiently
clear and strong language of the grave situation the
Government was creating by its ill-considered policy.
They knew their people. The bureaucracy evidently
dismissed it as bluff or, if it knew what was likely to
happen, encouraged it in the hope that the outbreak
might justify their opposition to, and dislike of, the
Montagu-Chelmsford scheme. In doing that they
have had to hatch the eggs they themselves laid.
These events have, besides, proved (<i>a</i>) that the lead
of the country has passed from the hands of the so
called &ldquo;natural leaders,&rdquo; the aristocracy of land,
money and birth; (<i>b</i>) that even the moderate leaders
have considerably lost in prestige and influence;
(<i>c</i>) that the lead has definitely passed into hands that
openly and frankly stand for self-determination and
self-government within the Empire and are prepared
for <i>any sacrifice</i> to achieve that end; (<i>d</i>) that the old
methods of governing India must now be discarded
once for all and the charge of provinces taken away
from sun-dried bureaucrats of the type of Sir Michael
O&rsquo;Dwyer and Sir Reginald Craddock.</p>

<p>The bloodshed in the Punjab, which outdid all
other Provinces in sending help during the war both
in men and money, pointed to the administration or
mal-administration of Sir Michael O&rsquo;Dwyer as responsible
for the nature and intensity of the outbreak.
If ever there was a British ruler of India who deserved
impeachment it is Sir Michael O&rsquo;Dwyer. He was not
only a tyrant and a snob of the worst order but he
was incompetent also. One of the two things must
have happened: Either he was out of touch with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span>
public feeling in the province or he deliberately provoked
this disaster by a policy of strength. In either
case he deserves to be publicly impeached and condemned
for incompetence or brutality or possibly for
both.</p>

<p>The following Summary of the orders passed by the
officer commanding shows the nature of the martial
law administered in the &ldquo;most loyal&rdquo; province in
India, a province which has so far been considered
to be the right arm of British R&aacute;j in India.</p>

<p>I have italicised some words and sentences for special
attention. The reader I hope will note the exceptions
in favor of the Europeans and the Indian servants in
the employ of the Europeans and also the reasonableness
of the other orders, threatening punishment upon
the owners of certain properties and requiring &ldquo;all
students,&rdquo; and all male persons belonging to private
Colleges in Lahore to attend four times a day at a
particular place for roll call. Order No. 14 is a gem
of great brilliance.</p>

<p>I have omitted order No. 6 as unimportant. Orders
from 8 to 12 inclusive are not available. What has
been given above, however, is quite sufficient to show
the nature of the martial law that has been applied
to the Punjab, after five years of unquestioned and
unrivalled loyalty to the British Empire, in the period
of greatest danger that had overtaken it. Such is the
reward of &ldquo;loyalty.&rdquo;</p>


<div class="sblockquot">
<h4>No. 1</h4>

<p>Whereas the Government of India has for good reasons proclaimed
Martial Law in the districts of Lahore and Amritsar; and</p>

<p>Whereas superior military authority has appointed me to command
troops and administer Martial Law in a portion of the Lahore
district, ... and whereas Martial Law may be briefly described<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span>
as the will of the Military Commander in enforcing law, order and
public safety:</p>

<p>I make known to all concerned that until further orders by me
the following will be strictly carried out:</p>

<p>1. At 20&middot;00 hours (8 o&rsquo;clock) each evening a gun will be fired from
the Fort, and from that signal till 05&middot;00 hours (5 o&rsquo;clock) on the
following morning no person <i>other than a European</i> or a person in
possession of a military permit signed by me or on my behalf will be
permitted to leave his or her house or compound or the building in
which he or she may be at 20 hours. During these prohibited hours
no person other than those excepted above will be permitted to use
the streets or roads, and any person found disobeying this order will
be arrested, and if any attempt is made to evade or resist that person
will be liable to be shot.</p>

<p>This and all other orders which from time to time I may deem
necessary to make will be issued on my behalf from the water-works
station in the city, whither every ward will keep at least four representatives
from 6 <small>A.M.</small>, till 17&middot;00 hours (5 <small>P.M.</small>) daily to learn what
orders, if any, are issued and to convey such orders to the inhabitants
of their respective wards. <i>The onus of ascertaining the orders issued
by me will rest on the people through their representatives.</i></p>

<p>2. Loyal and law-abiding persons have nothing to fear from the
exercise of Martial Law.</p>

<p>3. In order to protect the lives of his Majesty&rsquo;s soldiers and
police under my command, I make known that if any firearm is
discharged or bombs thrown at them the most drastic reprisals
will instantly be made <i>against property surrounding the scene of the
outrage</i>. Therefore it behooves all loyal inhabitants to see to it that
no evil-disposed agitator is allowed on his premises.</p>

<p>4. During the period of Martial Law I prohibit all processions,
meetings or other gatherings of more than 10 persons without my
written authority, and any such meetings, gatherings or processions
held in disobedience of this order will be broken up by force without
warning.</p>

<p>5. I forbid any person to offer violence or cause obstruction to
any person desirous of opening his shop or conducting his business
or proceeding to his work or business. Any person contravening
this order will be arrested, tried by a summary court and be liable
to be shot.</p>

<p>6. At present the city of Lahore enjoys the advantage of electric
lights and a water-supply; but the continuance of these supplies will
depend on the good behaviour of the inhabitants and their prompt
obedience to my orders.</p>


<h4>No. 2</h4>

<p>All tongas and tum-tums, (horse carriages) whether licensed for
hire or otherwise, will be delivered up to the Military Officer
appointed for that purpose at the Punjab Light Horse ground by
17&middot;00 (5 <small>P.M.</small>) to-day&mdash;Tuesday, 15th April. Drivers will receive
pay and horses be rationed.</p>

<p>All motor-cars or vehicles of any descriptions will be delivered
to the Military Officer appointed for that purpose at the Punjab
club by 17&middot;00 (5 <small>P.M.</small>) this day.</p>


<h4>No. 4</h4>

<p>By virtue of the powers vested in me I have prohibited the issue
of third or intermediate class tickets at all railway stations in the
Lahore Civil Command, <i>except only in the case of servants travelling
with their European masters or servants or others in the employ of the
Government</i>.</p>


<h4>No. 5</h4>

<p>Whereas, from information received by me, it would appear that
shops, generally known as Langars, for the sale of cooked food, are
used for the purpose of illegal meetings, and for the dissemination of
seditious <i>propaganda</i>, and whereas I notice that all other shops
(particularly in Lahore city) have been closed as part of an organized
demonstration against his Majesty&rsquo;s Government, now, therefore,
by virtue of the powers vested in me under Martial Law, I order
that all such Langars or shops for the sale of cooked food in the
Lahore civil area, except such as may be granted an exemption in
writing by me shall close and cease to trade by 10&middot;00 hours (10 <small>A.M.</small>)
tomorrow, Wednesday, the 16th April, 1919.</p>

<p>Disobedience to this order will result in the confiscation of the
contents of such shop and the arrest and trial by summary procedure
of the owner or owners.</p>

<h4>No. 7</h4>

<p>Whereas I have reason to believe that certain students of the
D. A. V. College in Lahore are engaged in spreading seditious <i>propaganda</i>
directed against his Majesty&rsquo;s Government, and whereas I
deem it expedient in the interests of the preservation of law and
order to restrict the activities of such students, I make the following
order:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>All students of the said college</i> now in this Command area will
report themselves to the Officer Commanding Troops at the Bradlaugh
Hall daily at the hours specified below and remain there until

be handed to such owners of property as I may select and it will be the
duty of such owners of property to exhibit and keep exhibited and undamaged
in the position on their property selected by me all such orders</i>.</p>

<p>The duty of protecting such orders will therefore devolve on
the owners of property and failure to ensure the proper protection
and continued exhibition of my orders will result in severe punishment.</p>

seditious or any other notices, proclamations or writing not authorized

<p>Whereas information laid before me shows that a martial law
notice issued by me and posted by my orders on a property known
as the Sanatan Dharam College Hostel on Bahawalpur road, has been
torn or otherwise defaced, in contravention of my Martial Law
Notice No. 8.</p>

<p>Now, therefore, by virtue of the powers vested in me under
martial law, I order the immediate arrest of <i>all male persons domiciled
in the said hostel and their internment in the Lahore Fort</i> pending my

<p>Whereas practically every shop and business establishment in the
area under my command has been closed in accordance with the

Government.</p>

<p>And whereas the continuance or resumption of such <i>hartal</i> is
detrimental to the good order and governance of the said area.</p>

<p>And whereas I deem it expedient to cause the said <i>hartal</i> to entirely
cease:</p>

<p>By 10&middot;00 hours (10 <small>A.M.</small>) tomorrow (Friday), the 18th day of
April, 1919, every shop and business establishment (except only

1919) in the area under my command, shall open and carry on its
business <i>and thereafter daily shall continue to keep open and carry on
its business</i> during the usual hours up to 20&middot;00 hours (8 <small>P.M.</small>) in
exactly the same manner as before the creation of the said <i>hartal</i>.</p>

or at any subsequent time I find this order has been with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</a></span>out
good and valid reason disobeyed, the persons concerned will be
arrested and tried under the summary procedure of martial law, and
shops so closed will be opened and kept open by force, any resultant
loss arising from such forcible opening will rest on the owners and on
occupiers concerned.</p>

<p>And I further warn all concerned that this order must be strictly
obeyed in spirit as well as in letter, that is to say, that to open a
shop and then refuse to sell goods and to charge an exorbitant or
prohibitive rate, will be deemed a contravention of this order.</p>

<p>[Note: Shops had evidently remained closed for seven days.]</p>

<p>Whereas it has come to my knowledge that the present state of
unrest is being added to and encouraged by the spreading of false,
inaccurate or exaggerated reports or rumours:</p>

law I give notice that <i>any person</i> found guilty of publishing, spreading

<p>These are only a few of the orders we have been able to obtain.</p>

<p>For weeks the Punjab was in a state of terror. Almost all of the
Native papers were either directly or indirectly suppressed or terrorized
into silence. Numerous persons were arrested and placed for
trial before military commissioners. Among them were a large number
of the most honored men in the province. Legal counsel from
outside the province was denied to them, and admission of newspapermen
into the province barred. In punishing the persons found
guilty the military commissioners have awarded sentences, the
parallel of which can only be found in the history of Czarism in
Russia. Flogging in the public was resorted to in more than one
place. In short, a complete reign of terror was established. So
great was the terrorism that the whole country was thrown into
such a paroxysm of rage, anger and despair as to make the people
forget the desire for a political constitution at this terrible price.</p></div>

<p>Just as I am writing these lines I learn from the
London <i>Times</i> that the reports of the two committees
that were sent to India to inquire into (<i>a</i>) questions
connected with the franchise and (<i>b</i>) the division of
functions between the Government of India and local
governments, and between the official and the popular
elements in the local governments, have been published
in Great Britain. In one of the Appendices is given a
rather brief and inadequate summary of the recommendations
of these committees published by the London
<i>Times</i>. At this stage it is impossible to make any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[Pg xxviii]</a></span>
comments except that the franchise is by no means as
broad as it could have been, the restriction of local
residence on candidates for the provincial Legislative
Councils extremely unreasonable, and the strength
of the Provincial Councils very meagre. The recommendations
are unsatisfactory in other respects also,
specially the power granted to the Governor to dismiss
ministers.</p>

<p>The question, however, is, &ldquo;Will the Cabinet stand
by these recommendations or will they allow them to
be whittled down?&rdquo; Mr. Montagu&rsquo;s bill, which is
promised to be introduced in the House of Commons
early in June, will answer the question.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I have to tender my thanks to my
friend Dr. J. T. Sunderland for having read my proofs.</p>

INTRODUCTORY</h2>

<div class="hblockquot">
<p>Now we are faced with the greatest and
the grimmest struggle of all. Liberty,
Equality, Fraternity, not amongst men,
but amongst nations&mdash;great and small,
powerful and weak, exalted and humble,&mdash;equality,
fraternity, amongst peoples
as well as amongst men&mdash;that is the
challenge which has been thrown to us....
My appeal to the people of this country,
and, if my appeal can reach beyond it, is
this, that we should continue to fight for
the great goal of international right and
international justice, so that never again
shall brute force sit on the throne of justice,
nor barbaric strength wield the sceptre of
right.</p>

<p class="ralign">
<span class="smcap">David Lloyd George</span><br />
</p>

<p class="squote">&ldquo;Causes and Aims of the War.&rdquo; Speech
delivered at Glasgow, on being presented
with the freedom of that city, June 29, 1917</p></div>


<p>We are told that the world is going to be reconstructed
on entirely new lines; that all nations, big or
small, shall be allowed the right of self-determination;
that the weaker and backward peoples will no longer
be permitted to be exploited and dominated by the
stronger and the more advanced nations of the earth;
and that justice will be done to all. &ldquo;What we seek,&rdquo;
says President Wilson, &ldquo;is the reign of law, based upon
the consent of the governed and sustained by the
organized opinion of mankind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Indian people also form a part of the world that
needs reconstructing. They constitute one-fifth of
the human race, and inhabit about two million square
miles of very fertile and productive territory. They
have been a civilized people for thousands of years,
though their civilization is a bit different from that of
the West. We advisedly say &ldquo;a bit different,&rdquo; because
in fundamentals that civilization has the same basic
origin as that of Greece and Rome, the three peoples
having originally sprung from the same stock and
their languages, also, being of common descent. For
the last 150 years, or (even) more, India has been ruled
by Great Britain. Her people have been denied any
determining voice in the management of their own
affairs. For over thirty years or more they have carried
on an organized agitation for an autonomous form
of Government within the British Empire. This
movement received almost no response from the responsible
statesmen of the Empire until late in the
war. In the meantime some of the leaders grew sullen
and downhearted, and, under the influence of bitter
disappointment and almost of despair, took to revolutionary
forms. The bulk of the people, however, have
kept their balance and have never faltered in their
faith in peaceful methods. When the war broke out
the people of India at once realized the world significance
of this titanic struggle and in no uncertain voice
declared their allegiance to the cause of the Allies.
Our masters, however, while gratefully accepting our
economic contributions and utilizing the standing
Indian army, spurned our offers for further military
contributions. In the military development of the Indians
they saw a menace to their supremacy in India.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>The Russian Revolution first, and then the entry of
the United States into the War, brought about a
change in the point of view of the British statesmen.
For the first time they realized that they could not
win the war without the fullest co&ouml;peration of the
people of India, both in the military and the economic
sense and that the fullest co&ouml;peration of the United
States also required as a condition precedent, quite a
radical revision of their war aims. President Wilson&rsquo;s
political idealism, his short, pithy and epigrammatic
formulas compelled similar declarations by Allied
statesmen. The British statesmen, at the helm of
affairs, found it necessary to affirm their faith in President
Wilson&rsquo;s principles and formulas if they would
not let the morale of their own people at home suffer
in comparison. In the meantime the situation in
India was becoming uncomfortable. The Nationalists
and the Home Rulers insisted on a clear and unequivocal
declaration of policy on the lines of President
Wilson&rsquo;s principles. The British statesmen in charge
of Indian affairs, at Whitehall, were still temporizing
when the report of the Royal Commission on the causes
of the Mesopotamia disaster burst out on the half-dazed
British mind like a bombshell. To the awakening
caused by the report and its disclosures a material
contribution was made by the outspoken, candid
and clear-cut speech of a younger statesman, whose
knowledge of the working of the Indian Government
could not be questioned. When the Parliament,
press and platform were all ablaze with indignation
and shame at the supposed incompetence of the Indian
Government, to whose inefficiency and culpable
neglect of duty were ascribed the series of disasters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
that ended with the surrender of a British force at
Kut-el-amara, Mr. Edwin Samuel Montagu, who had
been an Under Secretary for India under Lord Morley
and was at the time of the Mesopotamia disaster
Minister of Munitions, came out with a strong and
emphatic condemnation of the system and the form
of Government under which the &ldquo;myriads&rdquo; of India
lived and had their affairs managed. Mr. Montagu&rsquo;s
opinion of the machinery of the Indian Government
was expressed as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;The machinery of Government in this country
with its unwritten constitution, and the machinery of
Government in our Dominions has proved itself sufficiently
elastic, sufficiently capable of modification,
to turn a peace-pursuing instrument into a war-making
instrument. It is the Government of India alone which
does not seem capable of transformation, and I regard
that as based upon the fact that the machinery is
statute-ridden machinery. The Government of India
is too wooden, too iron, too inelastic, too antediluvian,
to be any use for the modern purposes we have in
view. I do not believe that anybody could ever
support the Government of India from the point of
view of modern requirements. But it would do.
Nothing serious had happened since the Indian mutiny,
the public was not interested in Indian affairs, and
it required a crisis to direct attention to the fact that
the Indian Government is an indefensible system of
Government.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Regarding the Indian Budget Debates in Parliament,
he said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Does anybody remember the Indian Budget
Debates before the War? Upon that day the House
was always empty. India did not matter, and the
Debates were left to people on the one side whom
their enemies sometimes called &ldquo;bureaucrats,&rdquo; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
on the other side to people whom their enemies sometimes
called &ldquo;seditionists,&rdquo; until it almost came to be
disreputable to take part in Indian Debates. It
required a crisis of this kind to realise how important
Indian affairs were. After all, is the House of Commons
to be blamed for that? What was the Indian
Budget Debate? It was a purely academic discussion
which had no effect whatever upon events in India,
conducted after the events that were being discussed,
had taken place.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>He held that the salary of the Indian Secretary
of State should be paid from the British Treasury,
and then there would be real debates:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;How can you defend the fact that the Secretaries
of State for India alone of all the occupants of the
Front Bench, with the possible exception of the Chancellor
of the Duchy of Lancaster, are not responsible
to this House for their salaries, and do not come here
with their Estimates in order that the House of Commons
may express its opinion....</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I am saying now is in the light of these
revelations of this inelasticity of Indian government.
However much you could gloss over those indefensible
proceedings in the past, the time has now come to
alter them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The tone of those Debates is unreal, unsubstantial
and ineffective. If Estimates for India, like Estimates
for the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,
and the Colonial Secretary were to be discussed on the
floor of the House of Commons, the Debates on India
would be as good as the Debates on foreign affairs.
After all, what is the difference? Has it even been
suggested to the people of Australia that they should
pay the salary of the Secretary of State for the Colony?
Why should the whole cost of that building in Charles
Street, including the building itself, be an item of the
Indian taxpayer&rsquo;s burden rather than of this House
of Commons and the people of the country?&rdquo;</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>Can and does the House of Commons control the
India Office? Here is Mr. Montagu&rsquo;s answer.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;It has been sometimes questioned whether a democracy
can rule an Empire. I say that in this instance
the democracy has never had the opportunity
of trying. But even if the House of Commons were
to give orders to the Secretary of State, the Secretary
of State is not his own master. In matters vitally
affecting India, he can be overruled by a majority of
his Council. I may be told that the cases are very
rare in which the Council has differed from the Secretary
of State for India. I know one case anyhow,
where it was a very near thing, and where the action
of the Council might without remedy have involved
the Government of India in a policy out of harmony
with the declared policy of the House of Commons and
the Cabinet. And these gentlemen are appointed for
seven years, and can only be controlled from the
Houses of Parliament by a resolution carried in both
Houses calling on them for their resignations. The
whole system of the India Office is designed to prevent
control by the House of Commons for fear that there
might be too advanced a Secretary of State. I do
not say that it is possible to govern India through the
intervention of the Secretary of State with no expert
advice, but what I do say is that in this epoch now
after the Mesopotamia Report, he must get his expert
advice in some other way than by this Council of men,
great men though, no doubt, they always are, who
come home after lengthy service in India to spend the
first years of their retirement as members of the
Council of India.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does any Member of this House know much about
procedure in the India Office? I have been to the
India Office and to other offices. I tell this House
that the statutory organization of the India Office
produces an apotheosis of circumlocution and red tape
beyond the dreams of any ordinary citizen.&rdquo;</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>His own idea of what should be done at that juncture
was thus expressed:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;But whatever be the object of your rule in India,
the universal demand of those Indians whom I have
met and corresponded with, is that you should state
it. Having stated it, you should give some instalment
to show that you are in real earnest, some beginning of
the new plan which you intend to pursue, that gives
you the opportunity of giving greater representative
institutions in some form or other to the people of
India....</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I am positive of this, that your great claim to
continue the illogical system of Government by which
we have governed India in the past is that it was
efficient. It has been proved to be not efficient. It
has been proved to be not sufficiently elastic to express
the will of the Indian people; to make them into a
warring Nation as they wanted to be. The history of
this War shows that you can rely upon the loyalty of
the Indian people to the British Empire&mdash;if you ever
before doubted it! If you want to use that loyalty,
you must take advantage of that love of country which
is a religion in India, and you must give them that
bigger opportunity of controlling their own destinies,
not merely by Councils which cannot act, but by
control, by growing control, of the Executive itself.
Then in your next War&mdash;if we ever have War&mdash;in
your next crisis, through times of peace, you will have
a contented India, an India equipped to help. Believe
me, Mr. Speaker, it is not a question of expediency,
it is not a question of desirability. Unless you are
prepared to remodel, in the light of modern experience,
this century-old and cumberous machine, then, I
believe, I verily believe, that you will lose your right
to control the destinies of the Indian Empire.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>The quick and resourceful mind of Premier Lloyd
George at once grasped the situation. He lost no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
time in deciding what was needed. Probably over
the head of his Tory colleagues, possibly with their
consent, he gave the Indian portfolio to Mr. Montagu,
and told him quietly to set to business. Mr. Montagu&rsquo;s
first step was the announcement of August 20,
1917. On that date he made in the House of Commons
the following memorable statement:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;The policy of His Majesty&rsquo;s Government, with
which the Government of India are in complete accord,
is that of the increasing association of Indians in every
branch of the administration and the gradual development
of self-governing institutions with a view to the
progressive realisation of responsible government in
India as an integral part of the British Empire. They
have decided that substantial steps in this direction
should be taken as soon as possible, and that it is of
the highest importance as a preliminary to considering
what these steps should be that there should be a free
and informal exchange of opinion between those in
authority at home and in India. His Majesty&rsquo;s
Government have accordingly decided, with His
Majesty&rsquo;s approval, that I should accept the Viceroy&rsquo;s
invitation to proceed to India to discuss these matters
with the Viceroy and the Government of India, to
consider with the Viceroy the views of local Governments,
and to receive with him the suggestions of
representative bodies and others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would add that progress in this policy can only
be achieved by successive stages. The British Government
and the Government of India, on whom the
responsibility lies for the welfare and advancement of
the Indian peoples, must be judges of the time and
measure of each advance, and they must be guided by
the co-operation received from those upon whom new
opportunities of service will thus be conferred and by
the extent to which it is found that confidence can be
reposed in their sense of responsibility.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Ample opportunity will be afforded for public
discussion of the proposals which will be submitted in
due course to Parliament.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>It is obvious that the content of the second sentence
of paragraph two in the above announcement
is in fundamental opposition to the right of every
nation to self-determination, a principle now admitted
to be of general application (including, according to
the British Premier, even the black races inhabiting
the Colonies that were occupied by Germany before
the War, within its purview). The people of India
are not on the level of these races. Even if it be
assumed that they are not yet in a position to exercise
that right, fully and properly, it is neither right nor
just to assume that they shall never be in that position
even hereafter. The qualifications implied in that
sentence are, besides, quite needless and superfluous.
As long as India remains &ldquo;an integral part of the
British Empire&rdquo; she cannot draft a constitution which
does not meet with the approval of the British Parliament
and the British Sovereign. It is to be regretted
that the British statesmen could not rise equal to the
spirit of the times and make an announcement free
from that spirit of autocratic bluster and racial swagger
which was entirely out of place at a time when they
were making impassioned appeals to Indian manhood
to share the burdens of Empire by contributing ungrudgingly
in men and money for its defence. This
attitude is somewhat inconsistent with the statements
in paragraph 179 of the Montagu-Chelmsford Report,
wherein, after referring to the natural evolution of
&ldquo;the desire for self-determination,&rdquo; the distinguished
authors of the Report concede that &ldquo;the demand that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
now meets us from the educated classes of India is
no more than the right and natural outcome of the
work of a hundred years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In spite of this uncalled for reservation in the announcement,
it is perfectly true that &ldquo;the announcement
marks the end of one epoch and the beginning
of a new one.&rdquo; What makes the announcement
&ldquo;momentous,&rdquo; however, is not the language used, as
even more high-sounding phrases have been used
before by eminent British statesmen of the position
of Warren Hastings, Macaulay, Munroe, Metcalf and
others, but the fact that the statement has been made
by the Secretary of State for India, as representing
the Crown and the Cabinet who, in their turn, are
the constitutional representatives of the people of
Great Britain and Ireland. The statement is thus
both morally and legally binding on the British
people, though it will not acquire that character so
far as the people of India are concerned, unless it is
embodied in a Statute of Parliament. Is it too much
to hope that when that stage comes the second sentence
of the second paragraph might be omitted or so modified
as to remove the inconsistency pointed out above?</p>

<p>We have no doubt, however, that the language of
the announcement notwithstanding, the destiny of
India remains ultimately in the hands of the Indians
themselves. It will be determined, favorably or
unfavorably, by the solidity of their public life, by
the purity and idealism of the Indian public men to
be hereafter entrusted with the task of administration,
by the honesty and intensity of their endeavor to
uplift the masses, both intellectually and economically,
by the extent to which they reduce the religious and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
communal excuses that are being put forth as reasons
for half-hearted advance, and by the amount of political
unity they generate in the nation. The well known
maxim that those who will must by themselves be free,
is as good today as ever. They will have to do all
this in order to persuade the British Parliament to
declare them fit for responsible Government. Once
they show their fitness by deeds and by actual conduct,
no one can keep them in leading-strings.</p>

<p>Coming back to the announcement itself, would it
not be well to bear in mind that what differentiates
this announcement from the statutory declarations of
the Act of 1833 and the Royal proclamation of 1858
is not the language used but the step or steps taken to
ascertain Indian opinion, to understand and interpret
it in accordance with the spirit of the times and the
frankness and fairness with which the whole problem
is stated in the joint report of the two statesmen, who
are the present official heads of the Government of
India. Nor can it be denied that the announcement
and the report have received the cordial appreciation
of the Indian leaders.</p>

<p>We, that is, the Indian Nationalists, have heretofore
concerned ourselves more with criticism of the British
administration than with the problem of construction,
though our criticism has never been merely destructive.
We have always ended with constructive suggestions.
Henceforth, if the spirit of the announcement is translated
into deeds it will be our duty to co&ouml;perate actively
in constructive thought. Not that we refused co&ouml;peration
in the past, but the conditions and the terms on
which we were asked to co&ouml;perate made it impossible
for us to make an effective response.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>Several British critics of the Indian Nationalists
have from time to time charged them with lack of
constructive ability. They ignore the fact that
political conditions in India were an effective bar to
any display of ability.</p>

<p>The first attempt at constitution making was made
by the Congress in 1915, and as such was bound to be
rather timid and half-hearted. The situation since
then has considerably improved and the discussions
of the last twelve months have enabled the Secretary
for India and the Viceroy to claim that, in certain
respects, at least, their scheme is a more effective
step towards responsible Government than the scheme
promulgated jointly by the Congress and the Muslim
League. How far that claim can be substantiated
remains to be seen. This much is, however, clear:
come what may, along with the rest of the world, India
cannot go back to the pre-war conditions of life. The
high functionaries of the British Government in India
are also conscious of that fact, as one of them, the present
Lieutenant Governor of the United Provinces of
Agra and Oudh, a member of the Indian bureaucracy,
remarked only recently in a speech at Allahabad:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing will ever be the same,&rdquo; said Sir Harcourt
Butler; &ldquo;this much is certain, that we shall have to
shake up all our old ideals and begin afresh ... we
have crossed the watershed and are looking down on
new plains. The old oracles are dumb. The old
shibboleths are no more heard. Ideals, constitutions,
rooted ideas are being shovelled away without argument
or comment or memorial.... Our administrative
machine belongs to another age. It is top-heavy.
Its movements are cumbrous, slow, deliberate. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
rejoices in delay. It grew up when time was not
the object, when no one wanted change, when financial
economy was the ruling passion of Governments,
imperial and provincial. Now there are the stirrings
of young national life, and economic springtime, a
calling for despatch, quick response, bold experiment.
Secretariats with enormous offices overhang the
administration. An eminent ecclesiastic once told me
that Rome had, by centuries of experience, reduced
delay to a science; he used to think her mistress of
postponement and procrastination, but the Government
of India beat Rome every time. Only ecclesiatics
could dare so to speak of the Government of India.
I, for one, will not lay audacious hands on the chariot
of the sun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Coming, as it does, from a member of the Anglo-Indian
bureaucracy, this statement means much
more to the Indian people than even the words of the
British Premier. If this statement is not mere camouflage,
but represents a genuine change of heart on the
part of the British bureaucracy in India, then it is all
the more inexplicable to us why the new scheme of
the Secretary for India and the Viceroy should breathe
so much distrust of the educated classes of India.
Any way, we have nothing but praise for the spirit of
frankness and fairness which generally characterizes
the report. However we might disagree with the
conclusions arrived at, it is but right to acknowledge
that the analysis of the problem and its constituting
elements is quite masterly and the attempt to find a
solution which will meet the needs of the situation
<i>as understood by them</i> absolutely sincere and genuine.
This fact makes it all the more necessary that Indian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
Nationalists of all classes and all shades of opinion
should give their best thought to the consideration
of the problem in a spirit of construction and co&ouml;peration,
as distinguished from mere fault-finding. Nor
should it be forgotten for a moment that Mr. Montagu
and Lord Chelmsford were all the time, when drawing
their scheme, influenced by considerations of what,
under the circumstances, is practicable and likely to be
accepted, not only in India by the Anglo-Indian
bureaucracy and the non-official European community,
but by the <i>conservative</i> British opinion at home.
It is the latter we have to convince and win over
before the scheme has a ghost of a chance of being
improved upon. When we say <i>conservative</i> opinion
we include in that expression the Liberal and Labour
Imperialists also. We should never forget that it is
hard to part with power, however idealistic the individual
vested with power may be, and it is still
harder to throw away the chances of profit which one
(and those in whom one is interested) have gained by
efforts extending over a century and a half, and in the
exercise of which one sees no immediate danger. I
am of the opinion that hitherto Indian representation
in England has been extremely meagre, spasmodic and
inadequate to the needs of the situation. Outside
England, India&rsquo;s voice has been altogether unheard.
We have so far displayed an almost unpardonable
simplicity in failing to recognise that the world is so
situated these days that public opinion in one country
sometimes reacts quite effectively on public opinion
in another. It is our duty, therefore, to increase our
representation in England and to keep our case before
the world with fresh energy and renewed vigour, not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
in a spirit of carping denunciation of the British
Government of India, but with a desire to educate and
enlist liberal and right-minded opinion all over the
world in our favor. In the following pages an attempt
is made to examine the Montagu-Chelmsford report
in a spirit of absolute candour and fairness, with
practical suggestions for the improvement of the
scheme in the light of Indian and British criticism
thereupon.</p>

DEMOCRACY IN INDIA</h2>

<p>Before we take up the report of the Secretary for
India and the Viceroy we intend to clear the ground
by briefly meeting the almost universal impression that
prevails in educated circles in the West, that democratic
institutions are foreign to the genius of the Asiatic
peoples and have never been known in India before.
The latest statement to this effect was made by Mr.
Reginald Coupland of the <i>Round Table Quarterly</i>, in
an article he contributed to the <i>New Republic</i> (September
7, 1918) on &ldquo;Responsible Government in India.&rdquo;
We have neither the time nor the desire to go into the
question as it relates to other Asiatic countries, though
we might state, in general terms, that an impartial
study of Asiatic history will disclose that in the centuries
preceding the Reformation in Europe, Asia
was as democratic or undemocratic as Europe. Since
then democracy has developed on modern lines in
Europe. While Asia has gradually disintegrated and
fallen under foreign domination, Europe has progressed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
towards democracy. As regards India, however, we
intend to refer briefly to what historical evidence is
available.</p>

<p>Firstly, we wish to make clear what we understand
by &ldquo;democracy.&rdquo; There is no desire to enter
into an academic discussion of the subject nor to
burden this book with quotations from eminent thinkers
and writers. In our judgment, the best definition of
democracy so far has been furnished by Abraham
Lincoln, viz., &ldquo;the government of the people, by the
people and for the people,&rdquo; regardless of the process or
processes by which that government is constituted.
One must, however, be clear minded as to what is
meant by &ldquo;the people.&rdquo; Does the expression include
all the people that inhabit the particular territory to
which the expression applies, regardless of sex, creed,
color and race, or does it not? If it does, we are afraid
there is little democracy even in Europe and America
today. Until recently half of the population was
denied all political power in the State by virtue of
sex. Of the other half a substantial part was denied
that right by virtue of economic status or, to be more
accurate, by lack of economic status considered necessary
for the exercise of political power. Even now
the Southern States of the United States, Amendment
XV to the American Constitution notwithstanding,
effectively bar the colored people from the exercise of
the franchise supposed to have been accorded to them
by the amendment. In Europe, religious and social
bars still exist in the constitutions of the different
states. As Great Britain is supposed to be the most
democratic country in Europe, we cannot do better
than take the history of the growth of public franchise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
in that country as the best illustration of the growth
of democracy in the terms of President Lincoln&rsquo;s
formula.</p>

<p>Travelling backwards, the earliest democratic institutions
known to Europe were those of Greece and
Rome. In applying the term &ldquo;democratic&rdquo; to the
city republics of Greece and Rome it is ignored that
these &ldquo;republics&rdquo; were in no sense democratic. &ldquo;Liberty,&rdquo;
says Putnam Weale, &ldquo;as it was understood in
those two celebrated republics of Athens and Sparta
meant abject slavery to the vast mass of the population,
slavery every whit as cruel as any in the Southern
States of the American Union before the war of Liberation....
In neither of these two republics did the
freemen ever exceed twenty thousand, whilst the
slaves ran into hundreds of thousands, and were used
just as the slaves of Asiatics were used.<a name="FNanchor_1_2" id="FNanchor_1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_2" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Thus the
Greek republics were simply cities in which a certain
portion of the inhabitants, little qualified to exercise
them, had acquired exclusive privileges, while they
kept the great body of their brethren in a state of
abject slavery.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_2_3" id="FNanchor_2_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_3" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Discussing the nature of Roman
citizenship Putnam Weale remarks (p. 25) that &ldquo;in
spite of the polite fiction of citizenship, the destinies of
scores of millions were effectively disposed of by a
few thousands.&rdquo; This was true not only with regard
to the outlying parts of the Empire but even as to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
Italy itself. &ldquo;Roman liberty,&rdquo; continues Putnam
Weale, &ldquo;though an improvement on Greek conceptions,
was like all liberty of antiquity confined really
to those who, being present in the capital, could take
an active part in the public deliberations. It was the
liberty of city and not of a land. It was therefore
exactly similar in practise, if not in theory, to the kind
of liberty, which has always been understood in advanced
Asiatic states&mdash;the system of Government
by equipoise and nothing else. The idea of giving
those who lived at a distance from the capital any means
of representing themselves was never considered at
all; and so, it was the populace of the capital (or only
a part of it), aided by such force as might be introduced
by the contesting generals or leaders, which held all
the actual political power. <i>Representative Government</i>&mdash;the
only effective guarantee of liberty of any sort&mdash;<i>had
therefore not yet been dreamt of</i>.&rdquo; [The italics
are ours.]</p>

<p>Alison in his <i>History of Europe</i>, Vol. I, says: &ldquo;The
states of Florence, Genoa, Venice and Pisa were not in
reality free; they were communities <i>in which a few
individuals had usurped</i> the rights, and disposed of
the fortunes, of the great bulk <i>of their fellow citizens,
whom they governed as subjects or indeed as slaves</i>.
During the most flourishing period of their history,
the citizens of all Italian republics did not amount to
20,000, and these privileged classes held as many
million in subjection. The citizens of Venice were
2500 and those of Genoa 4500, those of Pisa, Siena,
Lucca and Florence taken together, not above 6000.&rdquo;
[Italics ours.] Coming to more modern times we find
it stated by Morse Stephens in his <i>History of Revolu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>tionary
Europe</i> that &ldquo;the period which preceded the
French Revolution and the era of war from the troubles
of which Modern Europe was to be born may be
characterised as that of the benevolent despots. The
State was everything, the nation nothing.&rdquo; Speaking
of the eighteenth-century conditions in Europe,
Stephens remarks that &ldquo;the great majority of the
peasants of Europe were throughout that century
absolute serfs&rdquo;; also that &ldquo;the mass of the population
of Central and Eastern Europe was purely agricultural
and in its poverty expected naught but the bare necessaries
of existence. The cities and consequently the
middle classes formed but an insignificant factor in
the population.&rdquo; These quotations reveal the real
character of the European democracy in ancient and
medi&aelig;val and even in early modern Europe up to the
end of the eighteenth century, or, to be more accurate,
to the time of the French Revolution. Compare this
with the following facts about the political institutions
of India, during the ancient and medi&aelig;val times:</p>

<p>(1) First we have the testimony of ancient Brahmanic
and Buddhistic literature, preserved in their
sacred books, about the right of the people to elect
their rulers; the duty of the rulers to obey <i>the law</i>
and their obligation to consult their ministers as well
as the representatives of the public in all important
affairs of State.</p>

<p>The Vedic literature contains references to non-monarchial
forms of Government,<a name="FNanchor_3_4" id="FNanchor_3_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_4" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> makes mention of
elected rulers and of assemblies of people, though the
normal as distinguished from universal form of Govern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>ment
according to Professor Macdonald was by Kings,
&ldquo;a situation which, as in the case of the Aryan invaders
of Greece and of the German invaders of England,
resulted almost necessarily in strengthening the
monarchic element of the constitution.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_4_5" id="FNanchor_4_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_5" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>In the <i>Aitreya Brahmana</i> occur terms which are
translated by some as representing the existence of
&ldquo;self-governed&rdquo; and &ldquo;kingless&rdquo; states. These authorities
have been collected, translated and explained by
K. P. Jayas Wal and Narendranath Law in a series
of articles published in the <i>Modern Review</i> of Calcutta.</p>

<p>The <i>Mahabharata</i>, the great Hindu epic, makes
mention of kingless states or oligarchies. &ldquo;In fact,&rdquo;
says Mr. Banerjea, &ldquo;all the Indian nations of these
times possessed popular institutions of some type or
other.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_5_6" id="FNanchor_5_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_6" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Professor Rhys Davids has said, in his <i>Buddhist
India</i>, that &ldquo;the earliest Buddhist records reveal the
survival side by side with more or less powerful monarchies,
of republics with either complete or modified
independence.&rdquo; He names ten such republics in
Northern India alone. In regard to the system of
Government effective within one of the tribes that
constituted a republic of their own, the same scholar
observes: &ldquo;The administrative and judicial business
of the clan was carried out in public assembly, at
which young and old were alike present in their common
Mote Hall. A single chief&mdash;how and for what period
chosen we do not know&mdash;was elected an officeholder,
presiding over the sessions, or, if there were no
sessions, over the State. He bore the title of <i>Raja</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
which must have meant something like the Roman
Consul or the Greek Archon.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_6_7" id="FNanchor_6_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_7" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> There is no evidence
of the existence of slaves or serfs in these communities.
Evidently all were freemen.</p>

<p>(2) We have the evidence of Greek historians of
the period who accompanied Alexander in his Asiatic
Campaign, or who, after Alexander&rsquo;s death, represented
Greek monarchs at the courts of Indian rulers.
&ldquo;Even as late as the date of Alexander&rsquo;s invasion,&rdquo;
says Mr. Banerjea, &ldquo;many of the nations of the Punjab
lived under democratic institutions.&rdquo; Speaking of
one of them called Ambasthas (Sambastai), the Greek
author of <i>Ancient India</i> says: &ldquo;They lived in cities in
which the democratic form of Government prevailed.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Curtius,&rdquo; adds Mr. Banerjea, &ldquo;mentions a powerful
Indian tribe, where the form of Government was
democratic, and not regal.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_7_8" id="FNanchor_7_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_8" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Similarly Arrian, another
Greek writer, is quoted as mentioning several other
independent, self-governing tribal communities who
lived under democratic forms of government and
bravely resisted the advance of Alexander. One of
them, when making submission to Alexander, told
him that &ldquo;they were attached more than any others
to freedom and autonomy, and that their freedom
they had preserved intact from the time Dionysos
came to India until Alexander&rsquo;s invasion.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_8_9" id="FNanchor_8_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_9" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> There
were some others which had an aristocratic form of
Government. In one of them mentioned in <i>Ancient<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
India</i>, &ldquo;the administration was in the hands of three
hundred wise men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another Greek writer, Diodoros, speaks of <i>Patala</i> as
&ldquo;a City of great note with a political constitution
drawn on the same lines as the Spartan.&rdquo; It may
safely be presumed that the Greek meant what he
said. Chanakya, the author of a great treatise on
political science, mentions many powerful oligarchies
that existed down to the fourth century <span class="smcap">A. D.</span> In one
of the inscriptions, said to be of the sixth century <span class="smcap">A. D.</span>,
the <i>Malavas</i> are referred to as living under a republican
form of Government.<a name="FNanchor_9_10" id="FNanchor_9_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_10" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>(3) Even when kingship became an established
institution the idea that the King was only a servant
of the people survived for a long time. His &ldquo;remuneration&rdquo;
was fixed at one-sixth of the produce. His subjects
had the right to depose him or to turn him out
if he failed in his duty. The authorities on these
points are collected by Mr. Banerjea on pp. 72 and 73
of his book.</p>

<p>(4) Similarly many authorities are quoted by Mr.
Banerjea on pp. 74 and 75 of his learned work showing
that, according to Hindu ideals practised in ancient
times, the king was not above the law. He was not
an autocrat. He was as much bound by the law as
his subjects. Laws were not made by kings. &ldquo;Legislation
was not among the powers entrusted to a king,&rdquo;
says Mr. Banerjea. &ldquo;There is no reference in early
Vedic literature to the exercise of legislative authority
by the king, though later it is an essential part of his
duties,&rdquo; says Prof. Macdonell.<a name="FNanchor_10_11" id="FNanchor_10_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_11" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p><p>(5) Assemblies and councils are quite frequently
mentioned both in the Rig and the Atharva Vedas.
&ldquo;The popular assembly was a regular institution in the
early years of the Buddhistic age (500 to 300 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>)&rdquo;
Chanakya mentions that in the King&rsquo;s Council the
decision of the majority should prevail.<a name="FNanchor_11_12" id="FNanchor_11_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_12" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Sukraniti
lays down elaborate rules of procedure for the conduct
of business in these assemblies. &ldquo;The Council was
the chief administrative authority in the kingdom.
The King was supposed not to do anything without
the consent of the Council.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_12_13" id="FNanchor_12_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_13" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> In <i>Kerala</i> State, South
India, during the first and second centuries of the
Christian Era, there were five assemblies one of which
consisted of &ldquo;representatives of the people summoned
from various parts of the State.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_13_14" id="FNanchor_13_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_14" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> &ldquo;From the Ceylon
inscriptions we learn that in that island all measures
were enacted by the King in Council, and all orders
were issued by and under the authority of the Council.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While all this is true of Ancient India, we cannot
claim the existence of the same system of Government
for medi&aelig;val India. Even as regards Ancient India,
all that is claimed is that it possessed as much democracy,
if not more, as Ancient Greece or Ancient
Rome. The non-existence of slavery in Northern
India gives it therefore a superior character to that of
the Ancient republics of Greece and Rome. In the
South, it is believed slavery did exist. Coming to
medi&aelig;val times generally known as the Mohammedan
period of Indian History consisting of two epochs,
from 400 to 1200 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> and from 1200 to 1800 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
we notice that the country enjoyed a durable kind of
government, cities under absolute rule, and villages,
as before, self-governed. The absolute rule was a
benevolent or malevolent despotism according to the
character of the Hindu or Moslem sovereign who
reigned. But in the villages India maintained a
democratic form of government right up to the beginning
of British rule; and though under British rule,
it has been practically superseded by the rule of the
officials, yet in some parts of the country the spirit
is still alive, as will appear from the following testimony
recorded by Mr. Sidney Webb in his Preface to Mr.
John Matthai&rsquo;s volume, <i>Village Government in British
India</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;One able collector of long service in Central India
informed me that he had been, until a few months
before, totally unaware that anything of the sort
existed in any of the villages over which he ruled.
But being led to make specific inquiries on the subject,
he had just discovered, in <i>village after village, a distinctly
effective if somewhat shadowy, local organization, in one
or other form of panchayat, which was, in fact, now and
then giving decisions on matters of communal concern,
adjudicating civil disputes, and even condemning offenders
to reparation and fine</i>. Such a Local Government
organization is, of course, &lsquo;extra-legal&rsquo; and has no
statutory warrant, and, in the eyes of the British
tribunals, possesses no authority whatever. But it
has gone on silently existing, possibly for longer than
the British Empire itself, and is still effectively functioning,
merely by common consent and with the very
real sanction of the local public opinion.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Mr. Matthai has also made a similar remark in
Paragraph 22 of his book (Introductory).</p>

<p>Village councils ordinarily called village <i>panchayats</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
have often been confounded with caste panchayats
and that fact has been emphasised to prove that these
Indian <i>panchayats</i> were or are anything but democratic.
Mr. Sidney Webb and Mr. John Matthai both have
controverted that position and upon good evidence.
Says Mr. Webb:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;One suggestion that these fragments of indigenous
Indian Local Government seem to afford is that we
sometimes tend to exaggerate the extent to which the
cleavages of caste have prevailed over the community
of neighbourhood. How often is one informed, &lsquo;with
authority,&rsquo; that the <i>panchayat</i> of which we catch
glimpses must be only a caste <i>panchayat</i>! It is plain,
on the evidence, that however frequent and potent
may be the <i>panchayat</i> of a caste, there have been and
still are <i>panchayats</i> of men of different castes, exercising
the functions of a Village Council over villagers of
different castes. How widely prevalent these may be
not even the Government of India can yet inform us.
But if people would only look for traces of Village
Government, instead of mainly for evidences of caste
dominance, we might learn more on the subject.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p class="noidt">Later on in the same paragraph Mr. Webb remarks
that, even where caste exists it has, in fact, permitted
a great deal of common life, and that it is compatible
with active village councils.</p>

<p>Besides the evidence furnished by the texts of
Hindu codes, law books and political treatises (like
the <i>Arthasastra</i> of <i>Kautalaya</i>), and N&iacute;t&iacute; Sh&aacute;str&aacute;, etc.,
other good evidence has been produced by Mr. Matthai
in support of the above-mentioned proposition.</p>

<p>In Paragraph 23 he refers to the <i>Madras Epigraphic
Report</i>, 1912-13, in support of the statement that
&ldquo;there were village assemblies in South India in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
tenth century <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>, which &lsquo;appear to have consisted
of all the residents of a village including cultivators,
professionals and merchants.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;In the <i>Private Diary of Anandaranga Pillay</i>, who
served as agent to Dupleix, the French Governor in
South India in the middle of the eighteenth century,
there is an entry referring to a village meeting to
consider a case of desecrating the village temple &lsquo;in
which people of all castes&mdash;from the Brahman to the
Pariah&mdash;took part.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p></div>

<p class="noidt">In Paragraph 24, he points out that a village council
(<i>Panchayat</i>) might either be an assembly of all the
inhabitants of the village or only a select committee
consisting of representatives selected on some recognized
principle. The first are common among less
developed communities like those of the aboriginal
tribes and the latter in more highly organized communities.</p>

<p>Evidences of bigger assemblies consisting of representatives
of more than one village, sometimes of
more than one district, to decide cases of importance
or dispute between whole villages are also cited in
Paragraphs 26 and 27 and 32. On the strength of
certain South Indian Inscriptions relating to the
Tamil Kingdoms of the 10th century <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>, it is stated
that the administration of the village was carried on
by no less than five or six committees, each vested with
jurisdiction relating to certain definite departments of
village life, though there was no fixed rule on the point.
In Paragraphs 33 and 34 the mode of election to the
committees and the qualifications for membership are
set down in detail. The procedure seems to have
been quite elaborate, though suited to the level of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
intelligence of the people concerned. These village
councils and committees looked after education,
sanitation, poor relief, public works, watch and ward,
and the administration of justice. To describe the
methods by which these departments of village life
were administered by the village councils requires too
much space, but we give two excerpts from Chapter
II on education:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;The history of village education in India goes
back perhaps to the beginnings of the village community.
The schoolmaster had a definite place
assigned to him in the village economy, in the same
manner as the headman, the accountant, the watchman,
and the artisans. He was an officer of the
village community, paid either by rent-free lands or
by assignments of grain out of the village harvest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The outstanding characteristics of the schools of
the Hindu village community were: (1) that they were
democratic, and (2) that they were more secular than
spiritual in their instruction and their general character....
Nevertheless, when we speak of the
democratic character of these early Hindu schools, it
is to be understood that they were democratic only
in this sense, that they were open not merely to the
priestly caste but to all the four superior castes alike.
There was never any question of admitting into the
schools those who lay outside the regular caste system
whose touch would have meant pollution, nor to the
great aboriginal populations of the country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is very similar to the public schools in the
Southern States, in the United States, where schools for
the white children are closed to coloured children and
vice versa.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>From what has been stated above it appears that
the general impression that democratic institutions are
<i>entirely</i> foreign to India is nothing but the survival of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
a prejudice originally due to ignorance of Indian
history. In collecting his evidence Mr. Matthai has
principally drawn upon South Indian sources. There
can be no doubt that abundant evidence of a similar
kind is available as regards North India and is waiting
to be collected, collated and sifted by other Matthais.
We do not contend that India had the same kind of
representative institutions as Modern Europe has.
In fact no part of the world had. They are all recent
developments. The democratic nature of an institution
does not depend on the methods of election but
on the people&rsquo;s right to express their will, directly, or
through their representatives, in the management of
their public affairs. It is clear that that idea was
never altogether absent from Indian life either in
theory or in practise. Even under the most absolute
autocracies, the bulk of the people managed their
collective affairs themselves. They organised and
maintained schools; arranged and paid for sanitation;
built public works; provided for watch and ward;
administered justice, and for all these purposes raised
revenues and spent them in a democratic way. They
did so, not only as regards the internal affairs of a
village, but applied the same principles in the larger
life of their district or districts. Such a people cannot
be said to have <i>always</i> lived a life dictated and held
together by force. Nor can it be said with justice
that the introduction of modern democratic methods
in such a country, among such a people, would be the
introduction of an exotic plant, with the spirit and
working of which it will take them centuries to be
familiar.</p>

<p class="squote">&ldquo;Causes and Aims of the War.&rdquo; Speech
delivered at Glasgow, on being presented
with the freedom of that city, June 29,
1917.</p></div>


<p>Every nation has a fundamental right to determine,
fix and work out her own ideals. Any interference
with this right by individuals or nations of foreign
origin is unnatural and unjust. The consent of the
governed is the only logical and just basis of governments.
These principles have been reiterated with
added force and masterly eloquence by President
Wilson in his addresses during the War. They have
been accepted and adopted by the Allied statesmen.
No statesman or publicist of standing in any of the
Allied countries can dare question the principles.
The difficulty, however, arises when we come to
apply them practically. At this point the practical
politician&rsquo;s genius for diplomacy discovers flaws that
provide excuses for the non-application of those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
principles if such course seems helpful to his nation or
his sovereign.</p>

<p>President Wilson has asseverated that &ldquo;the day of
conquest and aggrandisement is gone,&rdquo; which, in plain
language, means that the day of Imperialism is over.
And, in conformity with the principle stated in the
Declaration of Independence, that &ldquo;All nations have
the right to assume among the powers of the earth the
separate and equal station to which the laws of nature
and nature&rsquo;s God entitle them,&rdquo; President Wilson has
also said that &ldquo;every people have a right to choose the
sovereignty under which they shall live&rdquo;; that &ldquo;national
aspirations must be respected, and that &lsquo;self
determination&rsquo; is not a mere phrase; it is an imperative
principle of action, which statesmen will henceforth
ignore at their peril.&rdquo; Yet as <i>practical men</i> we must
not ignore the facts of life. The world is not at once
going to be an ideal place to live in even if it may
become one. It may be that the advanced nations of
the earth which just now divide the political and
economic control of the world between themselves
may accept the underlying policy of the following
statement (of President Wilson) that</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;This war had its roots in the disregard of the rights
of small nations and of nationalities which lacked the
union and the force to make good their claim to determine
their own allegiance and their own forms of
political life.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p class="noidt">and the proposed League of Nations might see that
a continuance of the injustice thus far done to small
or backward nations is no longer permitted. Being
practical men, however, we cannot build on the assump<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>tion
that at the end of this war the world is at once to
be transformed into a paradise and that full justice
will be done to all nations and all peoples alike. We
already notice a tendency to restrict the application
and the enforcement of these principles to the nations
of Europe by the more frequent use of the term &ldquo;free
nations.&rdquo; &ldquo;Free nations&rdquo; do not need to be freed.
It will be wise, therefore not to be carried off our feet
by these declarations and statements. Mr. Montagu
and Lord Chelmsford have pointedly reminded us of
the Indian saying, &ldquo;hanoz Delhi D&uacute;r Ast&rdquo; (i.e. &ldquo;Delhi
is yet far away&rdquo;). But even if they had not done so
we were not so simple as to be swept away by the
mere language of the war declarations. The wording
of the announcement of August 20, 1917, itself did not
leave us in doubt about the truth of the saying quoted
by Mr. Montagu and Lord Chelmsford. We have,
therefore, to test our ideals and aspirations by the
touchstone of practicability and expediency. Happily
for us there is, in theory, at least, a full agreement
between the political goal set up by the Indian Nationalists
of the Congress school (since endorsed by
the Home Rulers) and that set up by the authors of
the announcement of August 20th. This goal is
&ldquo;Self-Government within the Empire on terms of
equality with the other parts of it,&rdquo; in the language of
the Congress school or, &ldquo;Responsible Government as
an integral part of the British Empire,&rdquo; in the language
of the announcement. There is a party of Indian politicians
who want complete independence, but at present
their number is so limited that we need not take
serious consideration of their position in the matter.
The vast bulk of the educated classes are agreed:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p class="negidt">(<i>a</i>) That they are content to remain within the
British Empire if they are allowed a status of
equality with the self-governing dominions of
the Empire.</p>

<p class="negidt">(<i>b</i>) That what they want is an autonomous Government
on the lines of Canada, Australia and
the South African Union.</p>

<p class="negidt">(<i>c</i>) That they do not want any affiliation with any
other Foreign Government.</p>

<p>Much has been written and said about the loyalty
of the people of India to the British Government.
Opinions, however, differ as to its nature. Some say
it is the loyalty of a helpless people or, in other words,
a loyalty dictated by fear or force. Others say it is
the loyalty of opportunism. The British maintain
that the loyalty is the outcome of a genuine and
sincere appreciation of the blessings of the British
Empire. Be that as it may, it is in the interest of
both to bring about circumstances and conditions
which would transform this loyalty whatever its nature
into one of genuine affection and interest. The
announcement of August 20, 1917, may be considered
as a first step towards the creation of such loyalty,
but much will depend on the steps that are taken to
give practical effect to the policy embodied in the
said announcement and on the spirit in which the
proposed reforms are carried out. Mr. Montagu and
Lord Chelmsford&rsquo;s conception of the &ldquo;eventual future
of India is a sisterhood of states, self-governing in all
matters of purely local or provincial interest, in some
cases corresponding to existing provinces, in others
perhaps modified in area according to the character
and economic interests of their people. Over this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
congeries of States should preside a Central Government
increasingly representative of and responsible
to the people of all of them; dealing with matters,
both internal and external, of common interest to the
whole of India; acting as arbiter in interstate relations
and representing the interests of all India on equal
terms with the self-governing units of the British
Empire.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_1_15" id="FNanchor_1_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_15" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The only changes that we would propose
in the language of this statement are (i) the omission
of the word &ldquo;increasingly&rdquo; which is rather misplaced
in the conception of an ideal, and (ii) the substitution
of the word &ldquo;Commonwealth&rdquo; in place of &ldquo;Empire.&rdquo;
His Highness the Aga Khan considers the use of the
term &ldquo;responsible&rdquo; government instead of &ldquo;self-government&rdquo;
in the announcement as unfortunate
because it carries the technical meaning of a government
responsible for its existence to an assembly
elected by the people. On the other hand, self-government
can comprise many and varied forms of expression
of the popular will. Further, he is convinced that the
words &ldquo;responsible government&rdquo; were used in order to
carry with the Secretary of State and the Prime
Minister some more conservative members of the
small war cabinet. It was camouflaged so that the
Executive government hereafter might contain Englishmen,
while at the same time the administration became
sufficiently liberal to be responsible to the people.
With due respect to the Aga Khan we do not see the
logical connection between the two. Responsible
government may or may not involve the necessary
inclusion of Englishmen in the Cabinet. Although
we may not approve of the interpretation of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>expression &ldquo;responsible&rdquo; government given to it by
the authors of the report, in our judgment its use as
an ideal to be attained expresses more forcibly the
right of the people to choose their government than
the use of the general term &ldquo;self government&rdquo; would.</p>

<p class="squote">&ldquo;No Halfway House.&rdquo; Speech delivered
at Gray&rsquo;s Inn, December 14, 1917.</p></div>


<p>In the chapter on ideals we have shown that there
is almost complete agreement between the bulk of
Indian educated men and the British authorities as
to the immediate goal of Government in India. There
is no such agreement, however, as regards the stages
by which that goal is to be reached, nor on the steps
which should be immediately taken to carry us to the
first stage. The four formulas by which Mr. Montagu
and Lord Chelmsford profess to be guided in their
recommendations are not accepted in their entirety by
the spokesmen of the Indian people. These formulas
are:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(1) There should be as far as possible complete
popular control in local bodies and the largest possible
independence for them of outside control. (Paragraph
188.)</p>

<p>(2) The provinces are the domain in which the
earlier steps towards the progressive realization of
responsible government should be taken. Some measure
of responsibility should be given at once, and our
aim is to give complete responsibility as soon as conditions
permit. This involves at once giving the
provinces the largest measure of independence, legislative,
administrative, and financial, of the Government
of India which is compatible with the due discharge
by the latter of its own responsibilities. (Paragraph
189.)</p>

<p>(3) The Government of India must remain wholly
responsible to Parliament, and saving such responsibility,
its authority in essential matters must remain
indisputable pending experience of the effect of the
changes now to be introduced in the provinces. In
the meantime the Indian Legislative Council should be
enlarged and made more representative and its opportunities
of influencing government increased. (Paragraph
190.)</p>

<p>(4) In proportion as the foregoing changes take
effect, the control of Parliament and the Secretary of
State over the Government of India and provincial
Governments must be relaxed. (Paragraph 191.)</p></div>

<p>There is no difficulty in accepting the first and the
fourth formulas. There is some complaint that the
actual steps recommended for immediate adoption to
give effect to the policy of the first formula are not in
keeping with the spirit of the formula and are inadequate.
But this we can reserve for future consideration.</p>

<p>No objection can be taken to the first and the last
sentences of the second formula; though there is a
great divergence of opinion as regards the content of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
the second. It is maintained by some, and their
number is by no means small,<a name="FNanchor_1_16" id="FNanchor_1_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_16" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> that full responsibility
should be conceded to the provinces at once and that
there is nothing in the conditions mentioned in the
report which justifies the postponement thereof.</p>

<p>The third formula, however, is the one about which
there is not even a semblance of agreement. All
political parties and all qualified persons in India (we
mean, of course, Indians of Indian origin) are agreed
that the assumptions and presumptions upon which
this formula is based are wrong and unacceptable.
Native Indian opinion is fairly unanimous on the point.</p>

<p>There are some who claim full autonomy at once.
There are others who claim full autonomy except as
regards foreign relations, the control of native States,
the Army and the Navy. All insist that a beginning
of responsible Government must be made in the
Central Government also, and point out the absolute
necessity of conceding some measure, even if not full,
of fiscal autonomy. They can see no reason why
&ldquo;the Government of India must remain wholly responsible
to Parliament&rdquo; and why &ldquo;its authority must
remain indisputable.&rdquo; On these matters Indian
opinion joins issue with the distinguished authors of
the report. We will revert to the subject in another
chapter.</p>

delivered at Queen&rsquo;s Hall on the third
anniversary of the Declaration of War,
August 4, 1917.</p></div>


<p>The eminent authors of the report have devoted an
entire chapter to a consideration of what they call the
&ldquo;conditions of the problem.&rdquo; These may be considered
under two different heads: (a) those that
necessitate a rather radical reorganisation of the
Government of India; (b) those that prevent the
authors from recommending immediate responsible
government and justify the limitations of their scheme.</p>


<h4>IMMENSITY OF THE PROBLEM AND THE GRAVITY
OF THE TASK</h4>

<p>Before we take up the two sets of facts relied upon by
them in support of either position we may express our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
general agreement with them as regards the gravity of
the task and the immensity of the problem. The size
of the country and the vastness of its population are
the measure of the extent of the problem. The existence
of powerful vested interests at present possessed
by the ruling race which may be interfered with by
extended changes in the system of Government are
the measure of its gravity. &ldquo;The welfare and happiness
of hundreds of millions of people,&rdquo; which the
authors say are in issue cannot be adequately provided
for by any autocratic system of Government however
benevolent its purpose, and however magnificent its
organisation. An &ldquo;absolute government&rdquo; is an anachronism,
but when it is foreign it is doubly so. To
bring out &ldquo;the best in the people&rdquo; for their own
&ldquo;welfare and happiness&rdquo; as well as for that of mankind
in general, it is necessary that the people should be
free to develop on their own lines, manage their own
affairs, evolve their own life, subject only to such
restrictions as the general interests of humanity
demand; and subject to such guidance as the better
placed and more experienced people of the earth can
furnish.</p>

<p>The people of India are willing to be guided in their
development towards modern democracy by the people
of Great Britain and they would be grateful for their
co&ouml;peration in this difficult task, but they must be
made to realize that the task is their own and that
they should undertake it in a spirit of courageous
faith&mdash;faith in their destiny, faith in their ability to
achieve it, and faith in the friendship of the great
British nation. The test of all measures in relation
to the Government of India in future should be, not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
how far the people of India can co&ouml;perate, how far
they can be entrusted with responsibility, but how
far it is necessary <i>in their interests</i> to control and check
them. The difference between the two points of view
is fundamental and important. Mr. Montagu and
Lord Chelmsford have looked at the problem from the
former point of view; the Indian leaders want them
to look at it from the latter. They want the great
British nation to recognise the justice of India&rsquo;s claim
to manage her own affairs, and to keep in their hands
in future only such control as is absolutely necessary
(a) to enable the Indian people to conduct their business
efficiently and successfully, (b) to make them
fulfill their obligations to the great Commonwealth
of nations of which they hope soon to be a component
part. As long as British statesmen insist on looking
at the problem from the former point of view, they
will make mistakes and raise a not entirely unreasonable
suspicion of their motives. The moment they
adopt the other point of view, they remove all grounds
of distrust and create an atmosphere of friendliness in
which they can deal with the problem in a spirit of
mutual trust, absolute frankness and candid perspicacity.
There are many contentions of the British
statesmen which the educated Indians would gladly
admit to be valid and necessary were they sure that
their admission would not be used against them by
the power whom they habitually regard as their adversary.
There is much in this report which could
at once be struck out if both parties were actuated by
feelings of mutual trust and friendliness. It cannot
be denied that many of the proposed restrictions on
the power of the popular assemblies and the would-be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
Indian Administrators are the outcome of distrust.
It is no wonder then that the Indian leaders in their
turn are not quite sure of the face value of the many
professions of good will that characterise the scheme.
It is for the removal of this distrust that we appeal as
earnestly as we can to the better mind of Great Britain.</p>

<p>In looking at the conditions of the problem, there is
another fallacy which underlies the oft-exaggerated
estimates of the blessings of British rule in India by
British statesmen and British publicists. They compare
the India of today with the India of 1757 and at
once jump to the conclusion that &ldquo;the moral and
material civilisation of the Indian people has made
more progress in the last fifty years than during all
the preceding centuries of their history.&rdquo; The proper
comparison is of the Great Britain, the France, the
United States, the Germany, the Italy and the Japan
of 1757, with the India of that year and of India&rsquo;s
progress within the last century and a half, or even
within the last 50 years, with the progress of these
countries in the same period. We have no desire to
withhold credit for what Great Britain has done
in India, but what she has misdone or could have
done but failed to do, by virtue of her rule in India
being absolute and thus necessarily conditioned by
limitations inevitable in a system of absolute rule,
should not be forgotten.</p>

<p>The Indian critics of British rule in India have
repeatedly pointed out that what they condemned
and criticised was the <i>system</i> and not the personnel of
the Government, and the distinguished authors of the
Report &ldquo;very frankly recognise that the character of
political institutions reacts upon the character of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
people&rdquo; and that the exercise of responsibilities calls
forth capacity for it (Paragraph 130), which mainly
accounts for the conditions that serve as reasons for
withholding responsible government from the Indian
people. In discussing &ldquo;the basis of responsibility&rdquo;
Mr. Montagu and Lord Chelmsford very properly
point out that the qualities necessary for it are only
developed by exercise and that though &ldquo;they are
greatly affected by education, occupation and social
organisation&rdquo; &ldquo;they ultimately rest on the traditions
and habits of the people.&rdquo; &ldquo;We cannot go simply to
statistics for the measure of these things.&rdquo; Yet, unfortunately,
it is exactly these statistics that seem to
have influenced them largely in the framing of their
half-hearted measures. The two dominating conditions
which obsess them are (1) that the immense
masses of the people are poor, ignorant and helpless
far beyond the standards of Europe; and (2) that
there runs through Indian society a series of cleavages&mdash;of
religion, race and caste&mdash;which constantly
threaten its solidarity.</p>

<p>We admit the existence of these conditions, but we
do not admit that they are an effective bar to the
beginnings of responsible government even on that
scale on which European countries had it when the
conditions of life in those countries were no better
than they are now in India.</p>

<p>It is said that 226 of 244 millions of people in British
India live a rural life: &ldquo;agriculture is the one great
occupation of the people&rdquo; and &ldquo;the proportion of
these who even give a thought to matters beyond the
horizon of their villages is very small.&rdquo; We ask did
not similar conditions exist in Great Britain, France<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
and Germany before the inauguration of the Industrial
Revolution, and if they did, did they stand in the way
of their people getting responsible government or
parliamentary institutions? Everyone knows what
the conditions in France were in years immediately
preceding the Revolution. Italy was no better off
in the middle of the nineteenth century. Perhaps it
is not much better even today. The masses of the
people in these and other countries of Europe, including
Great Britain, were far more ignorant, poor and
helpless when these countries obtained parliamentary
government than they are in India today. And the
authors of the report are not unaware that similar
concerns are perhaps the main interests of the population
of some country districts in the United Kingdom
even today. In several of the Balkan States, Roumania,
Serbia and Bulgaria&mdash;in Italy and in the
component parts of Russia&mdash;the conditions are no
better, yet their right to autonomous government,
nay, even to absolute independence, is hardly questioned.
Moreover, as has been pointed out by Mr.
Sidney Webb,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;It is a mistake to assume that a land of villages
necessarily means what is usually implied by the
phrase, a people of villagers. In truth, India, for all
its villages, has been also, at all known periods, and

before, what Anglo-Saxon England, for instance was
<i>not</i> or the South African Republic in the days before
gold had been discovered, and what the Balkan
peninsula even at the present time may perhaps not
be, namely a land of flourishing cities, of a distinctly

and the high development of the manufactur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>ing
arts made possible by the concentration of population
and wealth, but likewise&mdash;what is much more
important&mdash;a secretion of thought, an accumulation
of knowledge, and a development of literature and
philosophy which are not in the least like the characteristic
products of villages as we know them in
Europe or America. And to-day, although the teeming
crowds who throng the narrow lanes of Calcutta or
Benares, Bombay or Poona, Madras or Hyderabad,
or even the millions who temporarily swarm at Hardwar
or Allahabad or Puri may include only a small percentage
of the whole population, yet the Indian social
order does not seem to be, in the European understanding
of the phrase, either on its good or on its bad
side, essentially one of the villagers. The distinction
may be of importance, because the Local Government
developed by peoples of villages, as we know of them
in Anglo-Saxon England, in the early days of the
South African Republic, and in the Balkan States, is
of a very different type from that which takes root and
develops, even in the villages, in those nations which
have also a City life, centers of religious activity,
colleges and universities, and other &lsquo;nodal points,&rsquo;
from which emanate, through popular literature, pilgrimages,
and the newspaper press, slow but far-spreading
waves of thought and feeling, and aspirations
which it is fatal to ignore.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_1_17" id="FNanchor_1_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_17" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p></div>

<p>We have also quoted, in the chapter on &ldquo;Democracy
in India,&rdquo; the statement of Morse Stephens, about
the condition of the people of Europe in the eighteenth
century.</p>


<h4>EDUCATIONAL BACKWARDNESS</h4>

<p>&ldquo;The Educational returns,&rdquo; remark the authors of
the Report, &ldquo;tell us much the same story,&rdquo; viz., the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
appalling dissimilarity of conditions in Europe and in
India. While it is painfully true that the percentage
of illiteracy in India is greater than in any of the
countries of Europe, we cannot admit that that fact is
a fatal bar to the beginnings of responsible government
in India or to the granting of a democratic constitution
to the country. Literacy is, no doubt, a convenient,
but by no means a sure index of the intelligence of the
people, even much less of their character. The political
status of a country is determined more by intelligence
and character than by literacy. In these the people
of India are inferior to none. By that we do not
mean that they are possessed of the same kind of
political responsibility as the people of the United
Kingdom or of France or of Germany or of the United
States, but only that by intelligence and character
they are quite fitted to start on the road to responsible
government, at least to such kind as was conceded
for the first time to Canada, Australia, Italy, the
Balkan States, Austria, Hungary, etc. The illiteracy
of the masses may be a good reason for not introducing
universal suffrage, but it is hardly a valid reason for
refusing a kind of constitution which may place India
in the same position, in the matter of responsible
Government, as Great Britain, France, Austria-Hungary,
Italy and the United States were when
those countries showed the same percentage of illiteracy.
Literacy has nowhere been the test of political power.
Burma had almost no illiteracy when the British took
possession of it; its population was absolutely homogeneous
and the solidarity of the nation ran no risk
from &ldquo;cleavages of religion, race and caste.&rdquo; Even
today Burma has the highest figures of literacy in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
whole of British India. In that respect it occupies a
higher position than Roumania, Bulgaria, Serbia,
Greece, many of the Russian States and perhaps even
Italy and Hungary and possibly some of the South
American Republics. In the matter of race and religion,
too, its position is better than that of the countries mentioned,
yet the authors of the Report do not propose to
concede to it even such beginnings of responsible government
as they are prepared to grant to the other
provinces of India. The fact is that mere literacy
does not play an important part in the awakening of
political consciousness in a people. It is a useful
ingredient of character required for the exercise of
political power but by no means essential.</p>


<h4>POVERTY</h4>

<p>The argument based on poverty is of still less force.
On the other hand, it is the best reason why the people
of India should have the power to determine and
carry out their fiscal policy. We hope the admissions
made in Paragraph 135 of the Report which we bodily
reproduce<a name="FNanchor_2_18" id="FNanchor_2_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_18" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> will once for all dispose of the silly statement,
so often repeated even by men who ought to
know better, that materially India has been highly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>prosperous under British rule. If so, how is it that in
the language of the Secretary of State for India and
the Viceroy &ldquo;enormous masses of the population have
little to spare for more than the necessaries of life&rdquo;?
What about the prosperity of a province, one of the
biggest in India (the United Provinces), in which the
number of landlords (not tenants and farmers) whose
income derived from their proprietary holdings exceeds
&pound;20 ($100 a year, which comes to 30 cents a day for
the whole family), is about 126,000 out of a population
of 48 millions!</p>

<p>Acceptance of the argument of poverty as sufficient
to deprive people of political right is putting a premium
on it which is hardly creditable to the political ethics
of the twentieth century. It is the poorest and the
most ignorant in the community who most egregiously
suffer at the hands of autocracy. It is they who
require protection from it. The wealthy and the
educated know how to placate the bureaucrat and
get what they want. It is the poor who pay the
penalty of political helplessness, yet, curiously, it is
for them and in their interest that the English Government
in India proposes to withhold the power of the
purse from the proposed Indian Councils and insists
on denying the Indian people even the elements of
responsible government. While we admit the general
justice and accuracy of the observations made under
the head of &ldquo;extent of interest in political questions,&rdquo;
&ldquo;political capacity of the rural population,&rdquo; we fail
to see anything in them which justifies the conclusion
that the interests of the classes not politically minded
will be safer in the hands of the British officer, and on
the whole better protected by him than by his educated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
countrymen who are likely to get the power in case of
responsible government being conceded now. In our
judgment no greater argument for the immediate
grant of a substantial step in the direction of complete
responsible government throughout India and in all
spheres of government, could be advanced than what
is involved in the following observation of the authors
of the joint Report:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;The rural classes have the greatest stake in the
country because they contribute most to its revenues;
but they are poorly equipped for politics and do not
at present wish to take part in them. Among them are
a few great landlords and a larger number of yeoman
farmers. They are not ill-fitted to play a part in affairs,
but with few exceptions they have not yet done so.
But what is perhaps more important to appreciate
than the mere content of political life in India is its
rate of growth. No one who has observed Indian life
during even the past five years can doubt that the
growth is rapid and is real. It is beginning to affect
the large landholders: here and there are signs of its
beginning to affect even the villages. But recent
events, and above all the war, have given it a new
earnestness and a more practical character. Men are
coming to realise more clearly that India&rsquo;s political
future is not to be won merely by fine phrases: and
that it depends on the capacity of her people themselves
to face difficulties and to dispose of them.
Hence comes the demand for compulsory education,
for industries, for tariffs, for social reform, for social,
public and even military service.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>In the next paragraph, the authors approvingly
give an extract from an official report in which it is
frankly admitted that the rural population &ldquo;may not
be vocal, but they are certainly not voiceless.&rdquo; The
last meeting of the Indian Congress was attended by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
700 farmer delegates. Thousands of farmers have
joined the Home Rule Leagues. The statement that
&ldquo;hitherto they have regarded the official as their
representative in the Councils of the Government&rdquo; is
entirely devoid of any truth. In their eyes the official
is the Government itself. Some of them may think
that the official <i>represents</i> the Government, but to say
that they regard the official as &ldquo;<i>their representative</i> in
the Councils of the Government&rdquo; is a mere travesty
of truth. The paragraph on the &ldquo;interests of the
ryot&rdquo; bristles with so many unwarranted assumptions
that we must enter an emphatic protest against its
misleading nature.</p>

<p>But it gives us pleasure to accord our whole-hearted
support to the following statement with
which the paragraph opens:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;It is just because the Indian ryot is inarticulate
and has not been directly represented in our deliberations
that we feel bound to emphasise the great claim
he has upon our consideration. The figure of the
individual cultivator does not often catch the eye
of the Governments in Simla and Whitehall. It is
chiefly in the mass that they deal with him, as a consumer
of salt or of piece-goods, or unhappily too often
as the victim of scarcity or disease.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>It is true that &ldquo;the district officer and his lieutenants&rdquo;
are in a position to know the difficulties that
beset the ryot and his very human needs. But of
what good is this knowledge of the district officer and
his lieutenants to him if it has neither provided for
the education of his children nor made any provision
for his employment in occupations other than agriculture;
nor saved him from the intricacies of the law;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
nor protected him from the ubiquitous salt tax; nor
raised his wages proportionately to the increase of
prices; nor yet put him in a position to assert his
human rights and to obtain redress for his human, too
human, wrongs. If we examine a little more carefully
the merits of what is claimed to have been done for
him so far by &ldquo;an official Government,&rdquo; we will find
that the claim is by no means established.</p>

<p>We have no desire to deny that among the foreign
officers of the British Government in India there are
and have been a great many who were genuinely
anxious to help the ryot and do all which is claimed to
have been done for him in this paragraph, but that
they have been unable to do anything worth mentioning
will be admitted by every right-minded official.<a name="FNanchor_3_19" id="FNanchor_3_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_19" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
The reasons for their failure were not of their making.
The laws of the land made by the British legislators
fresh from the Inns of Court, the spirit of the administration
and the system of land taxation have effectively
prevented them from doing many of the things
which they might otherwise have liked to do. We
are sorry that the eminent statesmen responsible for
the report should have been the unconscious instruments
of producing an entirely wrong impression by
the statements in this paragraph. If the statements
are true, India must be a veritable paradise and the lot
of the Indian ryot enviable. But we know, and the
authors of the Report knew it as well, and they have
stated in so many words that it is not so. We can
quote any number of authorities to show that the
Indian ryot is the most pitiable figure in the whole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
length and breadth of India, if not in the whole world.
This is not the place to quote the easily accessible
opinions of eminently qualified and highly trustworthy
British writers and administrators on the subject.<a name="FNanchor_4_20" id="FNanchor_4_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_20" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
The English official Government has no doubt <i>professed</i>
to do all it claims to have done for the ryot, but how
far it has benefited him in these directions is another
story. To ask credit for having provided him with a
system of law &ldquo;simple, cheap and certain,&rdquo; or for
having established schools and dispensaries within
reasonable distance of his residence; or for even having
looked after his cattle, by the provision of grazing
lands; or for having supplied wood for his implements
is to run violently in the face of facts to the contrary.
These are verily his principal complaints against
British rule. The official Government is certainly
entitled to some credit for having started the co&ouml;perative
credit societies and a few co&ouml;perative rural banks
for the benefit of the peasantry, but the reform is so
belated and at present plays such an insignificant part
in the rural economy of India that it seems hardly
worth mentioning or discussing.<a name="FNanchor_5_21" id="FNanchor_5_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_21" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>But even assuming that the official Government
has so far done all that for the ryot, what reason is
there to insinuate that the Government of the people
will fail to do it for him in the future or will not do it
so well as or even better, than has been heretofore
done by the bureaucracy? It is quite a gratuitous
assumption that in future he will be required to do
all these things for himself. Even in the most advanced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
democracies in the world the peasantry or the masses
of the people do not do these things for themselves.
Most of these things are done by officials. The only
difference is that in a responsible government the
officials are the servants of the people while in an
absolute government they are their masters. We are
really surprised at the presumption of the British
bureaucrat, in posing as the special friend of the Indian
masses as against their own educated countrymen.
The experience of the past does not support the claim
and there is absolutely no reason to assume that it
will be different in the future. A mere cursory
glance at the resolutions of the Indian National Congress
passed continuously for a period of thirty years,
will show how persistently and earnestly the educated
classes have been pleading <i>inter alia</i> for (a) compulsory
and free education, (b) for technical instruction in
vocations, (c) for the reduction of the salt tax and the
land tax, (d) for the raising of the minimum incomes
liable to income tax, (e) for the provision of pasture
lands, (f) for the comforts of the third-class railway
travelling public, (g) for the milder administration of
the forest laws, (h) for the reform of the Police, etc.
All these years the bureaucracy did nothing for the
ryot and now they pose as his special friends, whose
continuance in power and in office is necessary for his
protection from the politically minded middle classes.
We are a friend neither of the landlord nor of the
capitalist. We believe that the ryot and the working
men in India as elsewhere are being exploited and
robbed by the classes in possession of the means
of production and distribution. We would wholeheartedly
support any scheme which would open a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
way to a just and righteous distribution of wealth and
land in India and which would insure the ryot and the
working man his rightful place in the body politic.
We would not mind the aid of the foreign bureaucracy
toward that end if we could be sure that the bureaucracy
would or could do it. But we have no doubts
in the matter that it cannot be done. The bureaucracy
has so far played into the hands of the plutocrat.
They have served first their own capitalists and then
the capitalists and landlords of India. Some among
them have tried to do a little for the submerged classes,
the poor ryot and the ill-paid sweated laborer, but
their efforts were of no consequence. They have
failed and their failure is writ large on the face of
the ryot. We are not sanguine that the politically
minded classes when they get power will immediately
rehabilitate the ryot and give him his due. We have
no hope of that kind. Yet we unhesitatingly support
the demand of the politically minded classes for a
responsible government in India. In our judgment,
that is the only way to raise the masses to a consciousness
of their rights and responsibilities. The experience
of the West tells us that in that way and in that way
alone lies salvation. Political consciousness must
travel from the classes to the masses and the longer
the inauguration of popular Government is delayed,
the greater the delay in the awakening of the ryot
and the working man. Absolutism must first give
way and transfer its power to the politically minded
classes, then will come the turn of the masses to demand
their rights and compel compliance. We can see no
risk of a greater harm or injury to the masses of India
from the transference of power from the hands of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
close bureaucracy of foreigners into the hands of the
educated and propertied oligarchy of their own countrymen.
Even in countries like Great Britain, America
and France it is the educated and the propertied
classes who rule. Why then this hubbub about the
impropriety and danger of giving power to the same
classes in India? Why are the representatives of
landlordism and capitalism in the British House of
Lords and among the ranks of Imperial Anglo-Indians
so solicitous of the welfare of the Indian masses, when
they have for so long persistently denied justice to
the proletariat of their own country? It is a strange
phenomenon to see the champions of privilege and
status, the defenders of capitalism and landlordism,
the advocates of the rights of property, the upholders
of caste in Great Britain, spending so much powder
and shot to <i>protect</i> the Indian ryot from the prospective
exploitation of him by the Indian Brahmin and the
Indian Banya<a name="FNanchor_6_22" id="FNanchor_6_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_22" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> (the priest and the capitalist). Let
the British Brahmin and the British Banya first begin
by doing justice to the proletariat of their own country
and then it will be time for them to convince the Indian
of their altruism and honesty of purpose in obstructing
the inauguration of responsible government in India in
the interests of the Indian proletariat. In this connection
the authors of the Report make some pertinent
observations which deserve to be quoted. After speaking
of &ldquo;religious animosities and social cleavages&rdquo;
and the duty of discouraging them the authors say:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Nor are we without hope that the reforms will
themselves help to provide the remedy. We would
not be misunderstood. Representative institutions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
in the West, where all are equal at the ballot box, have
checked but not abolished social exclusiveness. We
do not make a higher claim for similar institutions in
India than that they will help to soften the rigidity
of the caste-system. But we hope that these incidents
of it which lead to the permanent degradation and
ostracism of the lowest castes will tend to disappear in
proportion to the acceptance of the ideas on which the
new constitution rests. There is a further point.
An autocratic administration, which does not share
the religious ideas of the people, obviously finds its
sole safe ground in leaving the whole department of
traditional social usage severely alone. In such
matters as child-marriage, it is possible that through
excess of caution proper to the regime under which it
works, it may be actually perpetuating and stereotyping
customs which the better mind of India might be
brought, after the necessary period of struggle, to
modify. A government, in which Indians themselves
participate, invigorated by a closer touch with a more
enlightened popular opinion, may be able with all due
caution to effect with the free assent or acquiescence
of the Indians themselves, what under the present
system has to be rigorously set aside.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Nor are the authors unmindful of the effect of free
institutions on the character of the people as they
themselves over and over again recognise.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Free institutions have, as we have said, the faculty
of reacting on the adverse conditions in which the
start has to be made. The backwardness of education
may embarrass the experiment at the outset; but it
certainly ought not to stop it, because popular government
in India as elsewhere is sure to promote the
progressive spread of education and so a widening
circle of improvement will be set up.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_7_23" id="FNanchor_7_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_23" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>
<p>Among the authors&rsquo; reasons for what they call a
gradual advance they state the following also: (a) &ldquo;We
find it freely and widely admitted that they (i.e. the
Indians) are not yet ready.&rdquo; This admission may
legitimately be used against the total withdrawal of
all control of Indian affairs by the Parliament. Firstly,
it is questionable whether any such admission is really
&ldquo;freely and widely&rdquo; made. Secondly, the admission
justifies the retention of the powers of vital, general
supervision and general control and also the retention
of some Europeans in the higher services, but not the
total denial of all responsibility for maintaining law
and order and of all power to control the central
Executive. (b) That the responsibility of India&rsquo;s
defence is the ultimate burden which rests on the
Government of India; and this duty is the last
which can be intrusted to inexperienced or unskilful
hands.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;So long as India depends for her internal and
external security upon the army and navy of the
United Kingdom, the measure of self-determination
which she enjoys must be inevitably limited. We
cannot think that Parliament would consent to the
employment of British arms in support of a policy
over which it had no control and of which it might
disapprove. The defence of India is an Imperial
question: and for this reason the Government of
India must retain both the power and the means of
discharging its responsibilities for the defence of the
country and to the Empire as a whole.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>The defence of India involves, (a) men for the army
and the navy, (b) officers, (c) war materials and war
ships, (d) experts in strategy, (e) money. That India
pays for her defense and also contributes towards the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
defence of the Empire are facts which cannot be
questioned. That she shall continue to do so in the
future may also be assumed. That it is extremely
desirable that in the matter of war supplies she should
be self-dependent has been freely admitted. The
permanent Indian army as constituted in pre-war days
contained two-thirds Indians and one-third British.
If the present strength of the Indian army be examined
it will be found that the proportion of British troops is
still smaller. There is absolutely no need of British
soldiers in India for the purposes of defence, but if
the British Government wants to keep them as safeguards
against mutiny among the purely Indian army
or against the spirit of rebellion that at any time may
exhibit itself among the Indian people, then the British
exchequer must pay for them as it did in the case of
British garrison in South Africa or as the United States
does in the case of American troops in the Philippines.
It is adding insult to injury to argue that we should
not only pay for British troops but that the fact that
British troops form a constituent element of the
Indian army should be used against us for denying us
full responsibility even in civil affairs. The armies of
the various Asiatic Governments surrounding India
have no European elements in them and the Indian
soldier is as efficient a fighter as is needed as a protection.
That the Indian army should be almost
exclusively officered by the British is a survival of
the policy of mistrust, jealousy and racial discrimination
which has hitherto prevailed. It is time that
the Indian army should in future be mainly officered
by the Indians. Until that is achieved it must
continue as a tentative measure to be officered by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
the British, and the Indian Revenues must bear the
burden. But that is hardly any reason for denying
us full responsible government even on the civil side.
The Indians do not desire nor demand the transfer
of the control over the Army or the Navy until the
Army is principally officered by the Indians and an
Indian Navy has been built to supplement the Imperial
Navy. From this criticism of the reasons advanced
by the authors for a very mild &ldquo;advance&rdquo; (called
&ldquo;gradual&rdquo;) it is with pleasure that we turn to the
brighter side of the picture showing the favorable
features of the situation. The position of the educated
Indian is described fairly and squarely in Paragraph
140.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;The old assumption that the interests of the ryot
must be confided to official hands is strenuously denied
by modern educated Indians. They claim that the
European official must by his lack of imagination and
comparative lack of skill in tongues be gravely handicapped
in interpreting the thoughts and desires of an
Asiatic people.... Our educational policy in the
past aimed at satisfying the few, who sought after
English education, without sufficient thought of the
consequences which might ensue from not taking care
to extend instruction to the many. We have in fact
created a limited <i>intelligentsia</i>, who desire advance;
and we cannot stay their progress entirely until education
has been extended to the masses. It has been
made a reproach to the educated classes that they
have followed too exclusively after one or two pursuits,
the law, journalism or school teaching: and that these
are all callings which make men inclined to overrate
the importance of words and phrases. But even if
there is substance in the count, we must take note also
how far the past policy of Government is responsible.
We have not succeeded in making education practical.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
It is only now, when the war has revealed the importance
of industry, that we have deliberately set
about encouraging Indians to undertake the creation
of wealth by industrial enterprise, and have thereby
offered the educated classes any tangible inducement
to overcome their traditional inclination to look down
on practical forms of energy. We must admit that
the educated Indian is a creation peculiarly of our
own; and if we take the credit that is due to us for
his strong points we must admit a similar liability for
his weak ones. Let us note also in justice to him that
the progressive Indian appears to realise the narrow
basis of his position and is beginning to broaden it.
In municipal and university work he has taken a useful
and creditable share. We find him organising effort
not for political ends alone, but for various forms of
public and social service. He has come forward and
done valuable work in relieving famine and distress
by floods, in keeping order at fairs, in helping pilgrims,
and in promoting co-operative credit. Although his
ventures in the fields of commerce have not been
always fortunate, he is beginning to turn his attention
more to the improvement of agriculture and industry.
Above all, he is active in promoting education and
sanitation; and every increase in the number of
educated people adds to his influence and authority.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>The authors also say:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;We must remember, too, that the educated Indian
has come to the front by hard work; he has seized the
education which we offered him because he first saw
its advantages; and it is he who has advocated and
worked for political progress. All this stands to his
credit. For thirty years he has developed in his
Congress and latterly in the Muslim League free
popular convocations which express his ideals. We
owe him sympathy because he has conceived and pursued
the idea of managing his own affairs, an aim
which no Englishman can fail to respect. He has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
made a skilful, and on the whole a moderate, use of
the opportunities which we have given him in the
legislative councils of influencing Government and
affecting the course of public business, and of recent
years, he has by speeches and in the press done much
to spread the idea of a united and self-respecting India
among thousands who had no such conception in their
minds. Helped by the inability of the other classes
in India to play a prominent part he has assumed the
place of leader; but his authority is by no means
universally acknowledged and may in an emergency
prove weak.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>In face of these observations about the politically
minded classes of India it is rather unkind of the
authors to insinuate later on that in the interests of
the foreign merchant, the foreign missionary and the
European servants of the state it is necessary that the
Government of India should yet remain absolute and
that, in the provinces as well, important branches of
the administration should be excluded from the jurisdiction
of the popular assemblies.</p>

<p>To sum up, while we are prepared to concede that
the conditions of the problem may justify the withholding
of absolute autonomy,&mdash;political, fiscal, and
military,&mdash;for some time, there is nothing in them
which can in any way be deemed sufficient to deny
full political, and, if not complete, at least substantial
fiscal autonomy to the Indian people at once.</p>

THE PUBLIC SERVICES IN INDIA</h2>

all these cases [speaking of German colonies]
must be that the inhabitants should be
placed under the control of an administration
acceptable to themselves, one of whose main
purposes will be to prevent their exploitation
for the benefit of European capitalists or
Governments.</p>

1918.</p></div>


<p>Until now the European servants of the British
Government have ruled India quite autocratically.
The powers delegated to and the discretion vested in
them have been so large that they could do almost
anything they liked. They could make or mar the
fortunes of millions; they could further their happiness
or add to their misery by the simple fiat of their will.
The only limitation on their power was their own
sense of duty and justice. That some of them did let
themselves go is no wonder. The wonder is that the
instances of unbridled oppression and tyranny were
not more numerous than they have actually been.
Speaking of the European services generally, we have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
nothing but admiration for their general character.
The particular branch of the Public Services that has
been all along entrusted with the general administration
of the country is known as the Indian Civil Service.
It is recruited in England and is overwhelmingly
European in personnel. On April 1, 1913, only forty-six
of the 1319 civilians on the <i>cadre</i> were natives of
India.</p>

<p>Speaking of the executive organizations that have so
far ruled India, the eminent authors of the Report
for the reorganization of the Government of India
remark that it may &ldquo;well be likened to a mere system
of official posts, actuated <i>till</i> now by impulses of its
own, but affected by the popular ideas which impinge
on it from three sources&mdash;the British Parliament, the
legislative councils and the local boards.&rdquo; The
sentence would have been correct if in place of &ldquo;but
affected&rdquo; the authors had said &ldquo;and affected but
little.&rdquo; &ldquo;The system,&rdquo; they add, &ldquo;has in the main
depended for its effectiveness on the experience,
wisdom and energy of the services themselves. It
has, for the most part, been represented by the Indian
Civil Service which, though having little to do with
the technical departments of government, <i>has for over
100 years in practice had the administration entrusted
to its hands, because, with the exception of the offices of
the Governor General, Governors, and some members of
the executive councils, it has held practically all the
places involving superior control</i>. It has been in effect
much more of a government corporation than of a
purely civil service in the English sense. It has been
made a reproach to the Indian Civil Service that it
regards itself as the Government; but a view which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
strikes the critic familiar with parliamentary government
as arrogant is little more than a condensed
truth.&rdquo; [The italics are ours.]</p>

<p>The Indian Civil Service has thus developed all the
characteristics, good and bad, of a caste. It has been
a powerful bureaucracy, as exclusive, proud, arrogant
and self-sufficient,&mdash;if not even more so,&mdash;as the
original Brahmin oligarchy of the land, except that
while the Brahmin oligarchy had ties of race, religion
and culture with the rest of the population, the Indian
Civil Service is almost entirely composed of aliens.
The ancient Brahmins were, however, kept in check
by the military caste. The mutual jealousies of these
two castes afforded some kind of protection to the
people in general. But in the case of the British
Indian Civil Service, the military have given entire
support to their civilian fellow-countrymen and have
been completely under their will.</p>

<p>The Brahmins of India have left a monumental
record of their labors. They produced great thinkers,
writers, legislators, administrators and organizers.
In their own time they were as wise, energetic and
resourceful as any bureaucracy in the world has ever
been or will ever be. Yet the system of life they
devised cut at the roots of national vitality. It dried
almost all the springs of corporate national life. It
reduced the bulk of the population to a position of
complete subservience to their will, of blind faith in
their wisdom, of absolute dependence on their initiative.
It deprived the common people of all opportunities
of independent thought and independent
action. It brought about a kind of national atrophy.
And this, in spite of the fact that they began by im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>posing
a rigorous code of self-denial on themselves and
their class. For themselves they wanted nothing but
a life of poverty and asceticism. Their economic
interests were never in theory or in practice in conflict
with those of the rest of the body politic.</p>

<p>A Brahmin was forbidden to engage in trade or
otherwise accumulate wealth. His life was a life of
strict self-abnegation. This cannot be said of the
Indian Civil Servant. He receives a handsome salary
for his services, expects and receives periodic promotion
until he reaches a position which, from an economic
point of view, is not unenviable. After retirement he
is free to engage in trade and otherwise accumulate
wealth. But over and above this, what distinguishes
an Indian Civil Servant from an old Brahmin bureaucrat
is the fact that in India he represents a nation
whose economic interest may not always be in harmony
with those of the people of India. He is thus
supposed to be the guardian of the interests of his
countrymen, and is expected to further them as much
as he can without altogether endangering the safety
of British rule in India. Looked at from this angle,
we have no hesitation in saying that the work of the
Indian Civil Service, too, has in its way, been monumental.
As a rule, they have proved capable administrators,
individually honest, hardworking and alert.
They have organized and tabulated India in a way,
perhaps, never done before. But after all has been
said in their praise, it cannot be denied that they have
done India even more harm than the Brahmin oligarchy
in its time, did, by the support they lent to
economic exploitation of the country by men of their
own race and religion. Now, in this latter respect, we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
want to guard against being misunderstood. The
Indian Civil Service has, in the course of about a
century, produced a fairly good number of men who
have honestly and fearlessly stood for the protection
of Indian interests against those of people of their own
race and religion. In doing so they have sometimes
ruined their own prospects of promotion and advancement.
Whenever they failed in their self-imposed
task, and more often they failed than not, they failed
because the authorities at the top were forced by
considerations of domestic and imperial policy to do
otherwise. On the whole, the defects of the bureaucratic
administration were more the defects of the
system than of the individuals composing it.</p>

<p>The Indian Civil Servant, like the old Brahmin, is
autocratic and dictatorial. He dislikes any display of
independence by the people put under his charge.
He discourages initiative. He likes to be called and
considered the <i>Mai bap</i> (mother and father) of his
subjects. On those who literally consider him such
he showers his favors. The others he denounces and
represses. This has, in the course of time, led to
national emasculation. That is our chief complaint
against the Indian Civil Service. Of the other services
we would rather not speak. They have by no means
been so pure and high-minded as the I. C. S., nor
perhaps so autocratic and dictatorial. The number of
men who misused their powers and opportunities to
their own advantage has been much larger in services
other than the I. C. S. Yet they all have done a
certain amount of good work for India; whether one
looks at the engineering works designed and executed
by them, or the researches they have made in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
science of healing and preventing disease, or the risks
they have run in preserving order or maintaining
peace one cannot but admire their efficiency and ability.
The grievances of the Indian Nationalists against the
Public Services in India may be thus summarized:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) That the services monopolize too much power
and are practically uncontrolled by and irresponsible
to the people of the country.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) That the higher branches of the services contain
too many foreigners.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) That these are recruited in England, and from
some of them the Indians are altogether barred.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) That even when doing the same work Indians
are not paid on the same scale as the Europeans.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) That the Government has often kept on men of
proved inefficiency and of inferior qualities.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) That, considering the economic conditions of
India, the higher servants of the Government are paid
on a scale unparalleled in the history of public administration
in the world.</p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) That the interests of the services often supersede
those of the country and the Government.</p>

<p>(<i>h</i>) And last, but not least, that by the gathering
of all powers of initiative and execution in their hands
they have emasculated India.</p>

<p>As regards (<i>a</i>) we have already quoted the opinion
of the eminent authors of the report. The principle
laid down in the announcement of August 20, and the
scheme proposed are supposed to do away with the
element of irresponsibility. It is obvious that with
the introduction of the principle of popular control
into the Government, the power of individual servants
of the executive will not remain what it is now, or has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
been in the past. Much that is vested in and done by
the service will be transferred to public bodies elected
by popular vote. This will naturally affect (<i>b</i>) and
(<i>c</i>) also. We will here stop to quote again from the
Report:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;In the forefront of the announcement of August
20 the policy of the increasing association of Indians
in every branch of the administration was definitely
placed. It has not been necessary for us, nor indeed
would it have been possible, to go into this large
question in detail in the time available for our inquiry.
We have already seen that Lord Hardinge&rsquo;s Government
was anxious to increase the number of Indians
in the public services, and that a Royal Commission
was appointed in 1912 to examine and report on the
existing limitations in the employment of Indians....
The report was signed only a few months after
the outbreak of war, and its publication was deferred
in the hope that the war would not be prolonged.
When written, it might have satisfied moderate Indian
opinion, but when published two years later it was
criticised as wholly disappointing. Our inquiry has
since given us ample opportunity of judging the importance
which Indian opinion attaches to this question.
While we take account of this attitude, a factor which
carries more weight with us is that since the report
was signed an entirely new policy toward Indian
government has been adopted, which must be very
largely dependent for success on the extent to which
it is found possible to introduce Indians into every
branch of the administration.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>The authors of the Report then proceed to state the
limitations of the process, subject to the general
remark that at the present moment there are few
Indians (we do not admit this) trained in public life,
who can replace the Europeans, and thus to alter the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
personnel of a service must be a long and steady
process. They admit that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;If responsible government is to be established in
India there will be a far greater need than is even
dreamt of at present for persons to take part in public
affairs in the legislative assemblies and elsewhere;
and for this reason the more Indians we can employ
in the public services the better. Moreover, it would
lessen the burden of Imperial responsibilities if a body
of capable Indian administrators could be produced.
We regard it as necessary, therefore, that recruitment
of a largely increased proportion of Indians should be
begun at once.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>In the next paragraph they state why, in their
judgment, it is necessary that a substantial portion of
the services must continue to be European. Their
reasons may be gathered from the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;The characteristics which we have learned to
associate with the Indian public services must as far
as possible be maintained and the leaven of officers
possessed of them should be strong enough to assure
and develop them in the service as a whole. The
qualities of courage, leadership, decision, fixity of
purpose, detached judgment and integrity in her public
servants will be as necessary as ever to India. There
must be no such sudden swamping of any service with
any new element that its whole character suffers a
rapid alteration.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>On these grounds they make the following recommendations:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;I. That all distinctions based on race be removed,
and that appointments to all branches of the public
service be made without racial discrimination&rdquo; (Paragraph
315).</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;II. That for all the public services, for which there
is recruitment in England open to Europeans and
Indians alike, there must be a system of appointment
in India, ... and we propose to supplement it by
fixing a definite percentage of recruitment to be made
in India.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;III. We have not been able to examine the question
of the percentage of recruitment to be made in India
for any service other than the Indian Civil Service.
The Commission recommended that 25 per cent.
of the superior posts of that service should be recruited
for in India. We consider that changed conditions
warrant some increase in that proportion, and we
suggest that 33 per cent. of the superior posts should
be recruited for in India, and that this percentage
should be increased by 1&frac12; per cent. annually until the
periodic commission is appointed which will re-examine
the whole subject.... We have dealt only with the
Indian Civil Service, but our intention is that there
should be in all other services now recruited from
England a fixed percentage of recruitment in India,
increasing annually.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Now we must admit that this is certainly a distinct
and marked advance on the existing situation. The
Indian Constitutional party, however, wants to have
the percentage of recruitment in India fixed at 50 per
cent., retaining at the same time the annual increase
suggested. In our opinion, this difference is not
material, provided the number of posts to which the
rule of percentage is to be applied is substantially
reduced. We may state our position briefly.</p>

<p>We are of the opinion that the system of administration
in India is much more costly than it should be,
considering the sources and the amounts of Indian
revenues. Unless the industries of the country are
developed we can see no new sources of increased<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
taxation. Consequently, to us, it seems essential that
some economy should be effected in the various departments
of the administration. The only way to effect
that economy is to substantially reduce the number
of posts on which it is considered necessary to retain
a certain percentage of Europeans. In speaking of
the machinery of the Government of India, the authors
of the Report say:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;<i>We think we have reason for saying that in some
respects the machinery is no longer equal to the needs of
the time.</i> The normal work of the departments is
heavy. The collective responsibility of the Government
is weighty, especially in time of war. There is
little time or energy left for those activities of a political
nature which the new situation in the country
demands. A legislative session of the Government of
India imposes a serious strain upon the departments,
and especially on the members in charge of them.
But apart from the inevitable complexities of the
moment, the growing burden of business, which results
from the changing political conditions of the country,
is leading to an accumulation of questions which cannot
be disposed of as quickly as they present themselves.
We find the necessity for reforms admitted, principles
agreed upon, and decisions taken, and then long delays
in giving effect to them. Difficulties are realized,
enquiries are started, commissions report, and then
there is a pause. There is a belief abroad that assurances
given in public pronouncement of policy are
sometimes not fulfilled. On this occasion, therefore,
we have taken steps to guard against such imputations,
and to provide means for ensuring the ordered development
of our plans.&rdquo;</p>


<h4>PRESENT CAUSES OF DELAY</h4>

<p>&ldquo;267. The main fault for the clogging of the machine
does not, we think, lie altogether with its highly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
trained engineers. What is chiefly wanted is some
change of system in the directions of simplicity and
speed. <i>How does it happen that announcements are
made that arouse expectations only to defeat them?</i> We
know that it is not from any intention of deluding the
public. We suggest that it is because the wheels
move too slowly for the times; the need for change is
realized, but because an examination of details would
take too long, promises are made in general terms,
which on examination it becomes necessary so to
qualify with reservations as to disappoint anticipations,
and even to lead to charges of breach of faith. We
suspect that a root-cause of some political discontent
lies in such delays. Now, so far as the provinces are
concerned, we believe that our proposals <i>for freeing
them to a great extent from the control of the Government
of India and the Secretary of State will improve matters.
But the Government of India are in the worst case</i>.&rdquo;
[The italics are ours.]</p></div>

<p>These observations raise an apprehension in our
mind that it is proposed to add to the strength of
the services under the Government of India. We, for
ourselves, do not see how it can be otherwise. With
the steady admission of the popular element into the
Government of India the activities of the latter are
likely to increase rather than diminish; the secretarial
work of the different departments will expand rather
than contract. The question of questions is how to
meet the increased cost.</p>

<p>The remedy is the same as was suggested many
years ago by Sir William Hunter, the official historian
of India. He said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we are to give a really efficient administration
to India, many services must be paid for at lower
rates even at present. For those rates are regulated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
in the higher branches of the administration by the
cost of officers brought from England. You cannot
work with imported labor as cheaply as you can with
native labor, and I regard the more extended employment
of the natives, not only as an act of justice, but
as a financial necessity. If we are to govern the
Indian people efficiently and cheaply, we must
govern them by means of themselves, and pay for
the administration at the market rates for native
labor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, whatever may be said about the necessity of
maintaining a strong European element in the departments
which require initiative, courage, resourcefulness
and all the other qualities of &ldquo;leadership&rdquo; they are
certainly not a <i>sine qua non</i> for efficiency in secretarial
work. We can see no reason why, then, the different
secretariats of the Government of India cannot be
manned mainly, if not exclusively, by Indians. Their
salaries need not be the same as those now paid to the
Europeans engaged in these departments. May we
ask if there is any country on earth where such high
salaries are paid to the secretarial heads of departments
as in India? Secretaries to the Government of India
in the Army and Public works and Legislative departments
receive 42,000 Rs. each ($14,000, or &pound;2800 a
year); Secretaries to the Government of India in the
Finance, Foreign, Home, Revenue, Agriculture, Commerce
and Industry and Education departments get
Rs. 48,000 a year each ($16,000 or &pound;3,200); Educational
Commissioners from 30 to 36,000 Rs. ($10,000 to
$12,000).</p>

<p>These secretarial officers are not of Cabinet rank.
Besides their salaries they get various allowances, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
the purchasing value of the rupee in India is much
higher than that of 33 cents in the United States or of
16d. in the United Kingdom, the exchange equivalents
of an Indian rupee. The same remarks may be made
about Provincial Secretariats. We do not ignore the
fact that a European who cuts himself away from his
country and people for the best part of his life cannot
be expected to give his time, energy and talents for the
compensation he might accept in his own country,
nor that, if the best kind of European talent is desired
for India, the compensation must be sufficiently attractive
to tempt competent men to accept it. In Paragraphs
318 to 322, both inclusive, the Secretary of
India and the Viceroy have put forward a forceful
plea for improvement in the conditions of the European
Services by (<i>a</i>) increment in their salaries, (<i>b</i>) expediting
promotions, and (<i>c</i>) grant of additional allowances,
and also by bettering the prospects of pensions and
leave. We are afraid the only way to obtain the
concurrence of Indian public opinion in this matter,
if at all, is by restricting the number of posts which
<i>must</i> be held by Europeans. The <i>cadre</i> of services to
which the rule of percentage is to apply must be
reduced in strength, and if Europeans are required
for posts outside these they should be employed for
short periods and from an open market. For example,
it seems inconceivable to us why professional men like
doctors, engineers and professors should be recruited
for permanent service. Nor is there any reason why
the recruitment should be confined to persons of
British domicile. The Government of India must be
run on business principles. With the exception,
perhaps, of the higher posts in the I. C. S. and in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
Army, all other offices should be filled by taking the
supply on the best available terms for short periods and
from open market. By reducing the number of higher
posts to which the rule of percentage should apply,
the Government would be reducing the number of
Indian officers who could claim the same salary as is
given to their European colleagues. In our humble
opinion, the latter claim is purely sentimental, and
the best interests of the country require that the
administration should be as economical as is compatible
with efficiency. The strength of the different permanent
services should be reduced as much as possible
and the deficiency made up by the appointment of
the best persons available at the price which the
administration may be willing to pay, whether such
persons be European, Indian or American. Take the
Indian Educational Service, for example. The members
start with a salary of 6000 Rs. a year ($2000 or
&pound;400) and rise to about 24,000 Rs. a year ($8000 or
&pound;1600). In the United States, to the best of our
knowledge, few professors, if any, get a salary higher
than $7000 or 21,000 Rs. a year. High-class graduates
of Harvard, Yale and Columbia start their tutorial
careers at $2000 to $3000 a year, many at $1500 a
year. These men would refuse to go to India on a
similar salary. On the other hand, if a salary of
$4000 to $10,000 were offered to a select few, the
services of <i>the men at the top</i> might be had for a
short period. Surely, in the best interests of education,
it is much better to get first-class men on high
salaries for short periods than permanently to have
third-class men beginning with smaller salaries and
eventually rising to high salaries and ensuring to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
themselves life long pensions. What is true of the
Educational Service is similarly, if not equally, true
of the Medical, the Engineering and other scientific
services. At the present time we have men in these
technical services who received their education about
twenty or twenty-five years ago and whose knowledge
of their respective sciences is antiquated and rusty.
Apothecaries, absolutely innocent of any knowledge
of modern surgery, are often appointed to the post of
Civil Surgeons. No sensible Indian desires that the
present incumbents should be interfered with, except
where it is possible to retire them under the terms of
their service. All engagements should be met honorably.
What is needed is that in future there should
be a radical departure in the practice of appointing
non-Indians to responsible posts in India. We do not
want to deprive ourselves of the privilege of being
guided in our work by European talent, nor should
we grudge them adequate compensation for their
services. What we object to is (1) racial discrimination;
(2) excessive power being vested in individual
officers; (3) the employment of more than a necessary
number of persons of alien origin; (4) the crippling of
the country&rsquo;s resources by burdening its finances with
unnecessary pensions and leave allowances; (5) the
continuance of men on service lists long after their
usefulness has disappeared; (6) the filling of appointments
by jobbery, as is now done in the so-called
non-regulation provinces. We, in the Punjab, have
been &ldquo;blessed&rdquo; by the rule of several generations of
Smiths, Harrys and Jones. Those who failed to pass
the I. C. S. joined the <i>cadre</i> by the back door and
received the same emoluments as those who entered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
it by competition. It is they who block the avenues of
promotions and not the sons of the soil.</p>


<h4>COST OF ADMINISTRATION</h4>

<p>On the subject of the cost of administration it will
be instructive to compare the annual salaries allowed
to the highest public servants in India, the United
States and Japan.</p>

<p>The President of the United States, who ranks with
the great royalties of the world in position, gets a
salary of $75,000, without any other allowance. The
Prime Minister of Japan gets 12,000 yen, or $6000.
The Viceroy and the Governor General of India gets
250,000 rupees, or $83,000, besides a very large amount
in the shape of various allowances. The Cabinet
Ministers of the United States get a salary of $12,000
each, the Japanese 8000 yen or $4000, and the Members
of the Viceroy&rsquo;s Council, $26,700 each.</p>

<p>In the whole Federal Government of the United
States there are only three offices which carry a
salary of more than $8000. They are:</p>


<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align='left'>The President of the General Navy Board &nbsp; &nbsp;</td><td align='right'>$13,500</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Solicitor General</td><td align='right'>$10,000</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Assistant Solicitor General</td><td align='right'>$9,000</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>All the other salaries range from $2100 to $8000.
In the State Department all offices, including those of
the secretaries, carry salaries of from $2100 to $5000.
In the Treasury Department the Treasurer gets $8000,
three other officers having $6000 each. All the
remaining officials get from $2500 to $5000. In the
War Department there are only two offices which
have a salary of $8000 attached: that of Chief of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
Staff and that of Quartermaster General. The rest
get from $2000 to $6000. In the Navy Department,
besides the President of the General Board mentioned
above, the President of the Naval Examination Board
gets $8000 and so does the Commandant of the Marine
Corps. All the rest get from $6000 downwards.
In the Department of Agriculture there is only one
office carrying a salary of $6000. All the rest get
from $5000 downwards. The Chief of the Weather
Bureau, an expert, gets $6000. In the Commerce
Department four experts get $6000 each, the rest
from $5000 downwards.</p>

<p>In Japan the officials of the Imperial Household
have salaries ranging from $2750 to $4000. Officials
of the Higher Civil Service get from $1850 to $2100
a year; the Vice-Minister of State, $2500; Chief of
the Legislative Bureau, $2500; the Chief Secretary of
the Cabinet, $2500; and the Inspector General of
the Metropolitan Police, $2500; President of the
Administrative Litigation Court, $3000; President of
the Railway Board, $3750; President of the Privy
Council, $3000; Vice-President of the Privy Council,
$2750, and so on.</p>

<p>When we come to India we find that the President
of the Railway Board gets from $20,000 to $24,000
and that two other members of the Railway Board
get $16,000. Secretaries in the Army, Public Works,
and Legislative Departments get $14,000. Secretaries
in Finance, Foreign, Home, Revenue, Agriculture,
Commerce and Industry Departments get $16,000.
The Secretary in the Education Department gets
$12,000; Joint Secretary, $10,000; Controller and
Auditor-General, $14,000; Accountant-General, from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
$9,000 to $11,000; Commissioner of Salt Revenue,
$10,000; Director of Post and Telegraph, from $12,000
to $14,000.</p>

<p>Among the officers directly under the Government
of India there are only a few who get salaries below
$7000. Most of the others get from that sum up to
$12,000.</p>

<p>The United States includes forty-eight States and
territories. Some of them are as large in area, if not
even larger, than the several provinces of India. The
Governors of these States are paid from $2500 to
$12,000 a year. Illinois is the only State paying
$12,000; five States, including New York and California,
pay $10,000; two, Massachusetts and Indiana,
pay $8000; one pays $7000, and three pay $6000.
All the rest pay $5000 or less. There is only one
territory, the Philippines, which pays a salary of
$20,000 to its Governor-General.</p>

<p>In India the Governors of Madras, Bombay and
Bengal each receive $40,000, besides a large amount
for allowances. The Lieutenant-Governors of the
Punjab, the United Provinces, Bihar and Burma get
$33,000 each, besides allowances. The Chief Commissioners
receive $11,000 in Bihar, $18,700 in Assam,
$20,700 in the Central Provinces, and $12,000 in
Delhi. The Political Residents in the native States
receive from $11,000 to $16,000, besides allowances.</p>

<p>In Japan the governors of provinces are paid from
$1850 to $2250 per year, besides allowances varying
from $200 to $300.</p>

<p>The Provincial services in India are paid on a more
lavish scale than anywhere else in the world. In
Bengal the salaries range from $1600 for Assistant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
Magistrate and Collector to $21,333 to Members of
the Council, and this same extravagance is also true
of the other provinces.</p>

<p>Coming to the Judiciary, we find that Justices of
the Supreme Court of the United States get a salary of
$14,500 each, the Chief Justice getting $15,000; the
Circuit Judges get a salary of $7000 each; the District
Judges, $6000. In the State of New York the Judges
of the Supreme Court, belonging to the General Sessions,
get from $17,500 and those of the Special Sessions
from $9000 to $10,000 each. City Magistrates get
from $7000 to $8000. In India the Chief Justice of
Bengal gets $24,000; the Chief Justices of Bombay,
Madras and the United Provinces, $20,000 each.
The Chief Judges of the Chief Court of the Punjab and
Burma get $16,000 each and the Puisine Judges of
the High Courts the same amounts.</p>

<p>The Puisine Judges of the Chief Courts receive
$14,000. In the Province of Bengal the salaries of
the District and Session Judges range from $8,000 to
$12,000. District Judges of the other provinces get
from about $7000 to $12,000. The Deputy Commissioners
in India get a salary in the different provinces
ranging from $6000 to $9000 a year. The Commissioners
get from $10,000 to $12,000.</p>

<p>In Japan the Appeal Court Judges and Procurators
get from $900 to $2500 a year. Only one officer, the
President of the Court of Causation, gets as much as
$3000. The District Court Judges and Procurators
are paid at the rate of from $375 to $1850. It is
needless to compare the salaries of minor officials in
the three countries. Since the Indian taxpayer has
to pay so heavily for the European services engaged in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
the work of administration, it is necessary that even
Indian officers should be paid on a comparatively high
scale, thus raising the cost of administration hugely
and affecting most injuriously the condition of the men
in the lower grades of the government service. The
difference between the salaries of the officers and the
men forming the rank and file of the government
in the three countries shows clearly how the lowest
ranks in India suffer from the fact that the highest
governmental officials are paid at such high rates.</p>

<p>In New York City the Chief Inspector gets $3500
a year; Captains, $2750; Lieutenants, $2250; Surgeons,
$1,750; and Patrolmen, $1,400 each. In Japan
the Inspector General of the Metropolitan Police gets
$2500. The figures of the lower officials are not
available. But the minimum salary of a Constable
is $6.50 a month, besides which he gets his equipment,
uniform and boots free. In India the Inspectors
General get from $8000 to $12,000, the Deputy
Inspectors General from $6000 to $7200, District
Superintendents of Police from $2666 to $4800,
Assistants from $1200 to $2000, Inspectors from
$600 to $1000, Sub-inspectors from $200 to $400,
Head Constables from $60 to $80, Constables from
$40 to $48.</p>

<p>We have taken these figures from the <i>Indian Year
Book</i>, published by the <i>Times of India</i>, Bombay.
We know as a fact that the Police-Constables in the
Punjab are paid from $2.67 to $3.33 per month&mdash;that
is, from $32 to $40 per year. The reader should mark
the difference between the grades of salaries from the
highest to the lowest in India as compared with the
United States and Japan. While in India the lowest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
officials are frightfully underpaid, the highest grades
are paid on a lavish scale. In the other countries of
the world this is not the case.</p>


<h4>EDUCATIONAL DEPARTMENT</h4>

<p>In the United States (we quote the figures of New
York) the lowest grade school teachers get a salary of
$720, rising to $1500 a year. In the upper grades
salaries range from $1820 to $2260. Principals of
elementary schools receive $3500 and assistants
$2500. In the High Schools salaries range from $900
to $3150, in training schools from $1000 to $3250.
Principals of High Schools and Training Schools
receive $5000 and the same salary is paid to the
District Superintendent. The Commissioner of Education
in New York gets $7500.</p>

<p>In Japan the Minister of Education, who is a Cabinet
Minister, gets $4000, and the lowest salaries paid to
teachers range from $8 to $9 per month. In the
United States College Professors make from $3000 to
$5000 per year, a few only getting higher sums. In
Japan salaries range from $300 to $2000. Coming
to India we find that while the Administrative
officials and even the College Professors get fairly
high salaries, the teachers in the schools are miserably
underpaid.</p>

<p>Even the <i>Times of India</i>, an Anglo-Indian newspaper
published in Bombay, has recently commented on
the colossal difference between the salaries allowed
at the top and those allowed at the bottom. Yet
recently the Secretary of State has been sanctioning
higher leave allowances to the European officers of
the Indian Army.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>The Secretary of State for India in Council has
approved, with effect from January 1, 1919, the following
revised rates of leave pay for officers of the Indian
Army and Indian Medical service granted leave out
of India:</p>

</div>


<p>The present Governor of the Punjab (his precise
designation is Lieutenant Governor), who is the most
reactionary, self-complacent and conceited of all the
provincial rulers of India, has in the course of his
appeals for recruits for the present war said more
than once that the right of self-government carries
with it the responsibility of defending the country.
The distinguished authors of the Report have also
remarked in one place that so long as the duty of
defending India rests on Great Britain, the British
Parliament must control the Government of India.
Now let us see what the facts are.</p>

<p>(1) The first thing to be remembered in this connection
is that during the whole period of British rule
in India, not a penny has been spent by Great Britain
for Indian defence. The defence of India has been
well provided for by Indian Revenues. On the other
hand India has paid millions in helping Great Britain
not only in defending the Empire, but in extending<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
it.<a name="FNanchor_1_24" id="FNanchor_1_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_24" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Whatever protection has been afforded to India
by the British Navy&mdash;and that has by no means
been small&mdash;has been more than repaid by India&rsquo;s
services to the Empire in China, Egypt, South Africa
and other parts of the world. As to the military forces
of India, they consist of two wings: (<i>a</i>) the British and
(<i>b</i>) the Indian. The pre-war Indian army consisted
of 80,000 British and 160,000 Indians. Indian public
opinion has for decades been protesting against the
denial to Indians of officers&rsquo; commissions in the Indian
army, as also against the strength of the British element
therein. Every British unit of the Indian army from
the Field Marshal to the Tommy is paid for his services
by India. India pays for these services not only during
the time they form part of the Indian army but also
for their training and equipment. It pays all their
leave, transfer and pension charges. It even pays for
whatever provision is made in England for their
medical relief, etc. In the line of the military and
naval defence of India, Great Britain has not done as
much for India as she has done for the dominions and
self-governing colonies. Under the circumstances it
is adding insult to injury to insinuate that India has
in any way shirked the duty of providing for her
defence. We will say nothing of India&rsquo;s services during
the war.</p>

<p>In the military defence of India, the contribution of
the Punjab has always been the greatest. If the
British provinces are considered singly, it will be
found that the Punjab has been supplying the largest
number of units for the Indian army, not only in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
ranks of the fighters, but also in the ranks of auxiliaries.
During this war, too, the Punjab made the largest
contribution of both combatants and non-combatants.
Yet, if we compare the civil status of the people of the
Punjab with that of other provinces, we will find that
they have been persistently denied equality of status
with Bengal, Bombay and Madras. The Punjab
peasantry, which supplies the largest number of soldiers
to the army, is the most illiterate and ignorant of all
the classes of Indian population. Their economic and
legal position may better be studied in Mr. Thorborn&rsquo;s
<i>The Punjab in Peace and in War</i>. The Municipal and
Local Boards of the province do not possess as much
independence as has been conceded in the other
provinces. The judicial administration of the province
is as antiquated as it could possibly be under British
rule. Instead of a High Court we have still a Chief
court.<a name="FNanchor_2_25" id="FNanchor_2_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_25" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Captains and Majors and Colonels are still
performing judicial functions as magistrates and judges.
The trial by jury in the cases of Indians is unknown.
Until lately the Punjab was stamped with the badge of
inferiority by being called a non-Regulation province.
Even in this report the Secretary of State for India
and the Viceroy have spoken of it as a backward
province. It will thus be seen that the contribution
of the Punjab to the military strength of the Empire
has in no way benefited her population in getting
better opportunities for civil progress or greater civil
liberties. But recently the President of the Punjab
Provincial Conference uttered hard words against the
Provincial administration&rsquo;s policy of repression and
coercion. He said that their &ldquo;cup of disappointment,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
discontent and misery, in the Punjab, at any rate, was
full to overflowing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So much about the discharge of obligations for
military defence carrying with it the right of self-government.
The Indians have no desire to shirk
their responsibility for the military defence of India;
nor do they want to balk their contribution to the
Imperial defence. Their demands in this respect may
be thus summarised:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="negidt">(1) That the Indian Army should be mainly officered
by the Indians.</p>

<p class="negidt">(2) That as much as is possible of the arms and
ammunition equipment, and the military
stores required for the Indian army be produced
in India.</p>

<p class="negidt">(3) That the strength of the British element be
considerably reduced.</p>

<p class="negidt">(4) That the nature of the Indian army, which is at
present one of hired soldiers, be converted into
that of a National Militia with a small standing
army and a great reserve.</p>

<p class="negidt">(5) That in order to do it, some kind of compulsory
military training be introduced. All young
men between the ages of 17 and 21 may be
required to undergo military training and put
in at least one year of military service.</p>

<p class="negidt">(6) That as a preliminary step towards it the
existing Arms Act be repealed and, under
proper safeguards, the people be allowed to
carry and possess arms in peace and war, so
as to be familiar with their use.</p>

<p class="negidt">(7) That slowly and gradually, as funds can be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
spared from the other demands more urgent
and pressing, an Indian Navy be built.</p></div>

<p>Having explained the position of the Indian Nationalist
in this matter, we will now see what Mr. Montagu
and Lord Chelmsford say on this matter in their report.
In Paragraph 328 they state the &ldquo;Indian wishes&rdquo; and
point out that &ldquo;for some years Indian politicians have
been urging the right of Indians in general to bear
arms in defence of their country&rdquo;; and that &ldquo;we have
everywhere met a general demand from the political
leaders for extended opportunities for military service,&rdquo;
but that the subject being more or less outside the
scope of their enquiry and &ldquo;requirements of the
future&rdquo; being dependent &ldquo;on the form of peace which
is attained,&rdquo; they &ldquo;leave this question for consideration
hereafter with the note that it must be faced and
settled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In Paragraph 330 they deal with the question of
&ldquo;British Commissions for Indians.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;The announcement of his Majesty&rsquo;s Government
that &lsquo;the bar which has hitherto prevented the admission
of Indians to commissioned rank in His Majesty&rsquo;s
Army should be removed&rsquo; has established the principle
that the Indian soldier can earn the King&rsquo;s commission
by his military conduct. It is not enough merely to
assert a principle. We must act on it. The services
of the Indian army in the war and the great increase
in its numbers make it necessary that a considerable
number of commissions should now be given. The
appointments made so far have been few. Other
methods of appointment have not yet been decided on,
but we are impressed with the necessity of grappling
with the problem. We also wish to establish the
principle that if an Indian is enlisted as a private in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
British unit of His Majesty&rsquo;s Army its commissioned
ranks also should be open to him.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>The &ldquo;other methods of appointment&rdquo; that have
been announced since the report was signed are far
from satisfactory. It has been said that the responsibility
for this niggardly policy in the matter of admitting
Indians to the Commissioned ranks of the army rests
with the Home Government and that the Indian
Government&rsquo;s recommendations were much more
liberal. Now, as practical men, we fully realize that
for some time to come, at least until British suspicion
of India&rsquo;s desire to get out of the Empire is completely
removed by the grant of responsible government to
India, India&rsquo;s military policy and the Indian army
must be controlled by the British executive. On that
point all the parties in India are agreed. But it is
absolutely necessary that some steps be at once taken
to remove the stigma of military helplessness from
India&rsquo;s forehead. Let the British retain the control
and the command, but let us share the responsibility
to some extent and let our young men be trained for
the future defence of their Motherland. To deprive
them of all means of doing that, to charge them with
neglect of that paramount duty and then to urge it
as a disqualification of civil liberties, is hardly fair.</p>

THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY IN INDIA</h2>

<div class="hblockquot">
<p>The old world, at least, believed in
ideals. It believed that justice, fair play,
liberty, righteousness must triumph in the
end; that is, however you interpret the
phrase, the old world believed in God,
and it staked its existence on that belief.
Millions of gallant young men volunteered
to die for that divine faith. But if wrong
emerged triumphant out of this conflict,
the new world would feel in its soul that
brute force alone counted in the government
of man; and the hopelessness of the
dark ages would once more fall on the earth
like a cloud.</p>

</p>

<p class="squote">&ldquo;No Halfway House.&rdquo; Speech delivered
at Gray&rsquo;s Inn, December 14, 1917.</p>
</div>


<p>A whole section of the Report has been devoted
to a consideration of the claims of the European Community
in India. It is said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;We cannot conclude without taking into due
account the presence of a considerable community of
non-official Europeans in India. In the main they are
engaged in commercial enterprises; but besides these
are the missions, European and American, which in
furthering education, building up character, and in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>culcating
healthier domestic habits have done work
for which India should be grateful. There are also an
appreciable number of retired officers and others whose
working life has been given to India, settled in the
cooler parts of the country. When complaints are
rife that European commercial interests are selfish
and drain the country of wealth which it ought to
retain, it <i>is well to remind ourselves how much of India&rsquo;s
material prosperity is due to European commerce</i>.&rdquo;
[The italics are ours].</p></div>

<p>We have no desire to raise a controversy over the
assumption which underlies the last statement in the
above extract. The authors are themselves cognizant
of it when they remark, later on, that the &ldquo;benefit&rdquo;
which India has received by her commercial development
in European hands is &ldquo;not less because it was
incidental and not the purpose of the undertaking.&rdquo;
These are matters on which the Indian Nationalist
may well hold his own opinion and yet endorse the
spirit of the following observations:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Clearly it is the duty of British Commerce in India
to identify itself with the interests of India, which are
higher than the interests of any community; to take
part in political life; to use its considerable wealth
and opportunities to commend itself to India; and
having demonstrated both its value and its good
intentions, to be content to rest like other industries
on the new foundation of Government in the wishes of
the people. No less is it the wish of Indian politicians
to respect the expectations which have been implicitly
held out; to remember how India has profited by
commercial development which only British capital
and enterprise achieved; to bethink themselves that
though the capital invested in private enterprises was
not borrowed under any assurance that the existing
form of government would endure, yet the favourable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
terms on which money was obtained for India&rsquo;s development
were undoubtedly affected by the fact of British
rule; and to abstain from advocating differential
treatment aimed not so much at promoting Indian as
at injuring British commerce.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>We must say that the last insinuation is perfectly
gratuitous. Nor is it correct to say even by implication
that the non-official European community has
hitherto abstained from taking part in politics. The
fact is that Indian politics have hitherto been too
greatly dominated by the British merchant both at
home and in India. The British merchant doing
business in India had to submit to the prior claims of
the British manufacturers in Great Britain in matters
in which their interests did not coincide, but otherwise
their interests received the greatest possible attention
from the Government of India. In proportion to their
incomes derived from India by the employment of
Indian labour on terms more or less guaranteed to
them by the Indian Government&rsquo;s special legislation
they have made the smallest possible contribution to
the Indian Revenues; yet they have been the greatest
possible hindrance in the development of Indian
liberties. They have all the time owned a powerful
press which has employed all the resources of education
and enlightenment, all the powers of manipulating
facts and figures in maintaining and strengthening
the rule of autocracy in the country. We do not
propose to open these wounds. But we cannot help
remarking that so far they have exercised quite a
disproportionate influence in the decisions of the
Government of India. Those of them who are domiciled
in the country are our brothers and no Indian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
has the least desire to do anything that will harm
them in any way. Their importance must, in future,
be determined not by their race or colour or creed but
by their numbers, their education and their position
in the economic life of the country. They must no
longer lord it over the Indians simply because they
are of European descent. They should claim no
preferences or exemptions because of that fact. As
an integral part of the Indian body politic they are
entitled to all the consideration which they deserve
by virtue of their intellectual or economic position.
They should henceforth be Indo-British both in spirit
and in name. They will find the Indians quite ready
to forget the past and embrace them as brothers for
the common prosperity of their joint country.</p>

<p>As regards the other European merchants who are
not domiciled in India but are there just to make
money and return to spend it in their native land,
they are no more entitled to any place in the political
machinery of the Indian Government than the Hindus
who trade in the United States or in England. So
far every European, of whatever nationality he might
be, has occupied a position of privilege in India. He
was granted rights which were denied to the sons of
the soil. Every German or Austrian or Bulgarian
could keep or carry any number and kind of arms he
wanted without any license, while the natives of
India, even of the highest position, could not do so
unless exempted either by virtue of their rank or by
the favour of the Administration. Jews and Armenians,
Turks and Russians, Scandinavians, Danes,
Italians and Swiss all enjoyed the privilege. When
charged with any serious offence punishable by im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>prisonment
for more than six months, they could claim
trial by a jury having a majority of Europeans on it,
while no Indian outside the Presidency towns of Bombay,
Calcutta and Madras had that right. Even there,
the jury trying an Indian could include a majority
of Europeans. In the famous trial of Mr. B. G.
Tilak in 1908, the jury was composed of seven Europeans
and two Parsees. It is obvious that these
discriminations in favour of the Europeans must cease
and that no European not domiciled in India should
enjoy a position of special privilege. Indians are
noted for their hospitality and chivalry. Their own
codes of honor effectively prevent them from doing
any harm or injury to a foreigner. Every European
doing business in India or on any other errand is a
guest of honor and entitled to that treatment, provided
he does not assume racial superiority and look
down upon the people of the country and take advantage
of their being subjects of a European power.
No Indian will be so foolish as to injure the commercial
development of his country by scaring the
foreign trader or the foreign capitalist. All that
he wants is freedom to lay down the terms on which
that trade will be carried on consistently with the
interests of India&rsquo;s millions. What he stands for is
equality and reciprocity. As other peoples are free
to name the conditions on which the foreign trader
may do business in their countries, so must the Indians
be. Nothing more and nothing less than this is demanded.</p>

<p>As regards the citizens of the British Empire also,
the same right of reciprocity is demanded. We are
glad that the representatives of the Dominions have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
recognized the justice of that claim and expressed
their willingness to concede it.</p>

<p>Coming to the Missions, European and American,
the advice given is rather gratuitous. The Indians
have left nothing undone to show their gratitude to
them for the good work done by them in spite of the
fact that they, too, in the past, have not hesitated to
use the fact of their race and colour for the benefit
of their propaganda. The person of a religious man is
sacred in the eyes of an Indian, regardless of his particular
creed. The Christian missionary has so far
enjoyed a unique position of safety and freedom in
the country even to a greater extent than the Hindu
or the Moslem priest. The latter have often quarrelled
amongst themselves, but the former they have always
respected and honored. There is absolutely no reason
to think that this is likely to change in any way by the
grant of political liberty to the Indians.</p>

<p>It is possible, however, that, with the growth of free
thought in India, religious teachers of all denominations
may not continue to be the recipients of the same
honour as has been paid to them in the past by virtue
of their religious office. Dogmatic religion, whether it
be Hinduism, Mohammedanism or Christianity is in a
state of decay. In that respect India is feeling the
reaction of world forces and no amount of political
coercion or repression can stop it. In my humble
judgment the average Indian has thus far been more
tolerant of and more considerate to the Christian
missionary than the latter has been to the Indian.
Even in the matter of gratitude the Christian missionary
may with advantage learn from the Hindu.
The instances are not rare in which all the hospitality,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
respect and honor which a Christian missionary has
received during his stay in India have been repaid by
the latter&rsquo;s freely traducing the character of the
Indians in his home land. To no small degree is
the Christian missionary responsible for the feeling of
contempt with which the Indian is looked down upon
in America and other countries of the West. We do
not object to his speaking the truth, but it is not the
truth that he always speaks. Of gratitude, at least,
he gives no evidence.</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>The European Community in India is divided into two classes:
(a) pure Europeans, who number a little less than 200,000 in the
total population of 315,000,000. (178,908 in the British provinces
and 20,868 in the native States.)</p>

<p>(b) Anglo-Indians, hitherto called Eurasians, who number about
83,000 (68,612 in British territories and 15,045 in the Native States).
Thus the whole European community in India is less than 300,000.</p></div>

THE NATIVE STATES</h2>


<p>The Native States of India constitute one of the
anomalies of Indian political life. They are the honored
remnants of the old order of things&mdash;an order in which
personal bravery, resourcefulness and leadership with
or without capacity for successful intrigue enabled
individuals to carve out kingdoms and principalities
for themselves and their legal successors.</p>

<p>In the case of some of these Native States the
genealogies of the ruling houses go back to the early
centuries of the Christian era by historical evidence
and to pre-Christian times by tradition. Their origin
is somewhat shrouded in mystery. In popular belief
they are the descendants of gods&mdash;gods of light and
life, the Sun and the Moon. Next to the Royal
family of Japan, they are perhaps the only houses
among the rulers of the earth which can claim such an
ancient and unbroken lineage of royalty with sovereignty
of one kind or another always vested in them.
There have been times in their history when the
royal heads of these states had no house to live in and
no bed to sleep on, much less a territory to rule and an
army to command. This was, however, a part of
their royalty. In struggles against powerful enemies,
sometimes of their own race and religion, but more
often foreign aggressors of different blood and creed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
they were many a time worsted and driven to extreme
straits of poverty and helplessness. In peace or in
war, in prosperity or in misery, they never gave up the
struggle. Their right to lead their people and to rule
their country they never yielded for a moment. It is
true that sometimes they submitted to the superior
power of the enemy and accepted a position of subordination,
though in one case, at least, even this was
done only for a short time under the Moguls. In the
darker days of Indian history, when the military
devastation of foreign invaders left nothing but tears
and blood, ruin and ashes, defeat and misery in their
track, these houses kept the lamp of hope burning.
For full ten centuries they carried on a struggle of life
and death, sometimes momentarily succumbing before
the overwhelming force of their adversaries, but only
to rise again in fresh vigor and life to reclaim their
heritage and preserve their own and their country&rsquo;s
independence.</p>

<p>The <i>Sessodias</i> of Mewar called the <i>Ranas</i> of Mewar
(Udaipur) and the Rahtores of Marwar (including
Jodhpur, Bikaner, Rutlam, Kishangarh and Alwar)
have written many a glorious page of Mediaeval Indian
history and dyed it with their own blood as well as
that of their adversaries. Not only their men but
their women have made themselves immortal by their
bravery, chivalry, purity and self-immolation. The
one thing which distinguishes the Indian Rajput from
the peoples of other lands is that he has never waged
war against the poor, the helpless and the defenceless.
Numberless men gave their lives freely and ungrudgingly
not only in protecting the lives of their own women
and children but also in doing the same service to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
women and children of their enemies. The Rajput
never fought an unfair fight. He never took advantage
of the helplessness of his enemy and always gave him
right of way and the use of his best weapons for a free
and fair fight in the open. Anyone desirous of knowing
their deeds may read them in that poem in prose,
known as the Annals of Rajhasthan by Col. Todd.
Col. Todd has drawn a most faithful and thrilling
picture of Rajput bravery and Rajput chivalry in a
language worthy of the best traditions of English
literature. Here and there in matters of minor details
his authority has been questioned; otherwise the
results of his monumental labors still remain the best
picture of Rajput India. The Rajput States of India
are thus the objects of reverent honor to the 220
million Hindus of that country. Next to the Rajput
States comes the native ruling family of Mysore as
the representative of a very ancient Hindu Kingdom.
The Mahratta States are the remnants of the Mahratta
Empire and the Sikhs those of the Sikh Commonwealth.
The biggest of all the Indian Native States, Hyderabad,
arose out of the ruins of the Mogul Empire and is
supposed to be the most powerful guardian of Moslem
culture and tradition. From this description the
reader will at once see why the Native States are so
dear to the peoples of India and why the Indian educated
party has always stood by the Native States,
whenever either their treaty rights or the personal
dignity and status of their chiefs was threatened by
the British authorities. Lord Dalhousie&rsquo;s policy of
annexation by lapse was so much resented by the
people of India that it had almost cost the British
their Indian Empire. Only in the Native States do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
the Indians see remaining traces of their former independence.
That fact alone covers all the defects of
native rule or misrule in the States, in their eyes.
Some of these Native States have been so well administered
that in education, social reform and industrial
advancement they are far ahead of the neighboring
British territories. But their chief merit lies in the
fact that ordinarily the people get enough food to eat
and are seemingly happier than British subjects.
This fact has been noticed by several competent
observers of contemporary Indian life, among them
the Right Honorable Mr. Fisher, President of the
Board of Education in England. In his book <i>The
Empire and the Future</i> he has observed:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="noidt">&ldquo;My impression is that the inhabitants of a well
governed native state are on the whole happier and more
contented than the inhabitants of British India. <i>They
are more lightly taxed</i>; the pace of the administration is
less urgent and exacting; their sentiment is gratified by
the splendor of a native court and by the dominion of
an Indian government. They feel that they do things
for themselves instead of having everything done for
them by a cold and alien benevolence.&rdquo; (Italics
are ours)</p></div>

<p>But after all that is favourable to the Native States
of India has been said, their existence in their present
form remains a political anomaly. As at present
situated, they are an effective hindrance to complete
Indian unity. Although &ldquo;India is in fact as well as
by legal definition, one geographical whole,&rdquo; yet these
Native States, occupying about one-third of the total
area of the country and with a population of about
70 million will, for a long time, prevent its becoming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
a homogeneous political whole. Thus a circumstance
which was hitherto looked upon as a piece of good
luck will operate as a misfortune.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;The Native States of India are about 700 in number.
They embrace the widest variety of country and
jurisdiction. They vary in size from petty States like
Rewa, in Rajputana, with an area of 19 square miles,
and the Simla Hill States, which are little more than
small holdings, to States like Hyderabad, as large as
Italy, with a population of thirteen millions.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_1_26" id="FNanchor_1_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_26" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p></div>

<p>The general position as regards the rights and
obligations of the Native States has been thus summed
up by the distinguished authors of the joint Report
(Lord Chelmsford and Mr. Montagu):</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;The States are guaranteed security from without;
the paramount power acts for them in relation to
foreign powers and other States, and it intervenes
when the internal peace of their territories is seriously
threatened. On the other hand the States&rsquo; relations
to foreign powers are those of the paramount power;
they share the obligation for the common defence;
and they are under a general responsibility for the
good government and welfare of their territories.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>As regards the assimilation of the principles of
modern life, it is remarked in the same document:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Many of them have adopted our civil and criminal
codes. Some have imitated and even further extended
our educational system.... They have not all been
equally able to assimilate new principles. They are
in all stages of development, patriarchal, feudal or
more advanced, while in a few states are found the
beginnings of representative institutions. The characteristic
features of all of them, however, including<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
the most advanced, are the personal rule of the Prince
and his control over legislation and the administration
of justice.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Under the circumstances the question of questions
is how these territories are going to fall into line with
the British controlled area in the matter of the development
of responsible Government. We will once more
quote the opinion of the Secretary of State for India
and the Viceroy, who say:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;We know that the States cannot be unaffected by
constitutional development in adjoining provinces.
Some of the more enlightened and thoughtful of the
Princes, among whom are included some of the best
known names, have realised this truth, and have themselves
raised the question of their own share in any
scheme of reform. Others of the Princes&mdash;again
including some of the most honored names&mdash;desire
only to leave matters as they are. We feel the need
for caution in this matter. It would be a strange
reward for loyalty and devotion to force new ideas
upon those who did not desire them; but it would be
no less strange, if out of consideration for those who
perhaps represent gradually vanishing ideas, we were
to refuse to consider the suggestions of others who
have been no less loyal and devoted. Looking ahead
to the future we can picture India to ourselves only
as presenting the external semblance to some form of
&lsquo;federation.&rsquo; The provinces will ultimately become
self-governing units, held together by the central
Government which will deal solely with matters of
common concern to all of them. But the matters
common to the British provinces are also to a great
extent those in which the Native States are interested&mdash;defence,
tariffs, exchange, opium, salt, railways
and posts and telegraphs. The gradual concentration
of the Government of India upon such matters will
therefore make it easier for the States, while retaining<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
the autonomy which they cherish in internal matters,
to enter into closer association with the central Government
if they wish to do so. But though we have
no hesitation in forecasting such a development as
possible, the last thing that we desire is to attempt to
force the pace. Influences are at work which need no
artificial stimulation. All that we need or can do is
to open the door to the natural developments of the
future.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>In Paragraphs 302 to 305 the authors of the Report
state the process by which this development may be
expedited. Disavowing any intention of forcibly
altering treaty rights, they propose to classify the
States into (<i>a</i>) those that have &ldquo;full authority over
their internal affairs,&rdquo; (<i>b</i>) those &ldquo;in which Government
exercises through its Agents large powers of internal
control,&rdquo; (<i>c</i>) those who are really no more &ldquo;than mere
owners of a few acres of land.&rdquo; It is further pointed
out that hitherto the</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="noidt">&ldquo;general clause which occurs in many of the treaties
to the effect that the Chief shall remain absolute Ruler
of his country has not in the past precluded and does
not even now preclude &lsquo;interference with the administration
by Government through the agency of its
representatives at the Native Courts.&rsquo; We need hardly
say that such interference has not been employed in
wanton disregard of treaty obligations. During the
earlier days of our intimate relations with the States
British agents found themselves compelled, often
against their will, to assume responsibility for the
welfare of the people, to restore order out of chaos,
to prevent inhuman practices, and to guide the hands
of a weak or incompetent Ruler as the only alternative
to the termination of his rule. So too, at the present
day, the Government of India acknowledges as trustee,
a responsibility (which the Princes themselves desire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
to maintain) for the proper administration of States
during a minority, and also an obligation for the
prevention or correction of flagrant misgovernment.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>And also that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="noidt">&ldquo;the position hitherto taken up by Government has
been that the conditions under which some of the
treaties were executed have undergone material changes,
and the literal fulfilment of particular obligations which
they impose has become impracticable. Practice has
been based on the theory that treaties must be read as
a whole, and that they must be interpreted in the light
of the relation established between the parties not
only at the time when a particular treaty was made,
but subsequently.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>On these grounds it is proposed to establish a Council
of Princes to which questions which affect the States
generally or are of concern to the Empire as a whole,
or to British India and the States in common, may be
referred for advice and opinion. So long as the Princes
do not intervene either formally or informally in the
internal affairs of British India, we have no objection
to the scheme. On the other hand, we do hope some
method will be found by which, with the consent
of the parties interested the smaller principalities
scattered all over the country may, for administrative
purposes, be merged either in the British area or in
the bigger Native States which possess full power of
autonomy over their internal affairs. In the long run
it will be comparatively easy to convert the latter to
an acceptance of the modern principles of government
if the number of Native States is reduced and their
people achieve that solidarity which comes by community
of interests and ideas. In this connection
it is a happy augury for the future that some of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
highest Chiefs like those of Mysore, Baroda, Gwaliar,
Indore, Kashmir, Bikaner, Jodhpore, Alwar, and
Patiala are alive to the importance of marching with
the times. The people of British India owe them a
great debt of gratitude for the moral support they
have given to their claim for responsible Government
by coming out openly and freely in favour of the
proposed advance. We are sure that these Princes
will in due time take measures to bring their own
territories in line with the British provinces and thus
strengthen the ties that bind them to their own peoples
as well as to the other people of India. After all,
there can be no manner of doubt, as the authors of
the report predict,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="noidt">&ldquo;that the processes at work in British India cannot
leave the States untouched and must in time affect
even those whose ideas and institutions are of the
most conservative and feudal character.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>It is the path of wisdom and sagacity to recognise
the world forces that are at work. No amount of
ancient prestige can prevent the people from coming
into their own. The age of despotism is gone and the
autocrats of today must sooner or later hand over
their powers to the people. The more they conciliate
them the longer perhaps they may be able to lead
them. They may continue as leaders for a long time,
but as autocratic dispensers of favours and fortunes
they cannot remain, perhaps not even for their life
time.</p>

<p>In our judgment this part of the Montagu-Chelmsford
Report is no less important for the future of Indian
democracy than the others that directly deal with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
British India, and we hope that whatever might be
the policy as regards the existing States the new law
will make it impossible for the Government of India
and the Secretary of State to create any new States in
the future. It is monstrous to transfer millions of
human beings from one kind of political rule to another
like so many cattle, as was done in 1911. The present
rule of any Indian Maharaja may be as good or as bad
as that of a British Governor or Lieutenant Governor,
but the latter has in it greater democratic potentialities
than the former, for the mere fact, if for no other, that,
while the British are more or less amenable to world
opinion, the rulers of Native States are not. It is
inhuman, and not in accord with modern ideas of
right and wrong to reward somebody&rsquo;s loyalty by
giving him power of life and death over numerous
fellow beings, otherwise than in due course of law.
Even the mighty British Government is not the owner
of the bodies and souls of its subjects in India. How,
then, can it assume the right of abandoning them to
the absolute rule of a single individual, however
worthy or loyal he may be? We hope this stupid way
of rewarding loyal services may be ended by an express
provision to that effect in the statute which will be
passed relating to the reorganization of the Government
of India.</p>

<p>In this connection the following observations made
in a leading editorial of the <i>Servant of India</i>, Poona
(February 16, 1919), are worthy of attention:</p>

<p>&ldquo;A hundred years ago, it was decidedly in the
interests of British rule, and probably also in the
interests of the people of India generally, that the small,
ill-governed, and eternally fighting states of India<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
should come under the suzerainty of a single powerful
power. It may be regarded as a historical misfortune
that this power happened then to be foreign, though
many regard this contact with a virile civilization as
the making of India. This suzerainty could then be
established duly by entering into treaties with these
states and guaranteeing them certain rights and privileges.
But these treaties have now assumed in the
eyes of the descendants of the original princes an air of
inspiration; they have become a kind of perpetuity.
They always come in the way of any improvement.
When any new policy is proposed to them, they are
always prepared to say, &lsquo;This is not in the bond.&rsquo;
One may be allowed to speculate as to how many of
these Highnesses would have survived to this day to
put forward this claim in the absence of the suzerain
power. Thrones in ancient days were as unstable
as they are becoming now in Europe. It is hardly
possible that the present popular wave in Europe
would not have touched our Native States. The
subjects of the states would have clamoured for a
recognition of their rights, and they would have had
their way. But now the princes feel quite secure.
Have they not got their treaties? As a result there
is no political life at all in the Native States. The
most ardent advocate of Home Rule would be most
violently against migration to a Native State. The
real problem of the Native States is how to get over
the treaties when they conflict with the interests of
their subjects. The questions discussed at the Chiefs&rsquo;
Conference leave us comparatively cold, as they entirely
neglect the people most concerned. The questions of
the rights of the chiefs and their salutes or precedence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
are in our opinion of a very secondary importance.
A renowned statesman in Europe gave at the utmost
a life of a dozen years to the most solemn treaty
between two countries, for in that period circumstances
alter and the solid foundation for the treaty cracks.
Is it not high time that the treaties with the chiefs
should be revised after over a hundred years? It
would indeed redound to their credit if the chiefs themselves
come forward to submit to such readjustment.
Perhaps their autocratic and irresponsible power may
have to suffer some diminution. But if they consent
to that diminution so as to give it to their subjects in
the modern democratic spirit, the real power and
influence of the Native States will increase incalculably.
It is in this direction we wish to see a solution of the
problem of the Native States which are nowadays
working as a brake on our national progress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Part II of the Report contains the scheme which
Mr. Montagu and Lord Chelmsford propose for the
solution of the problem which they had set themselves
to solve in Part I. In giving their reasons for a new
policy they observe:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;<i>No further development (on old lines) is possible
unless we are going to give the people of India some
responsibility for their own government.</i> But no one
can imagine that no further development is necessary.
<i>It is evident that the present machinery of government
no longer meets the needs of the time; it works slowly and
it produces irritation</i>; there is a widespread demand
on the part of educated Indian opinion for its alteration;
and the need for advance is recognised by official
opinion also.&rdquo; [Italics are ours.]</p></div>

<p>The new policy sketched by them is, in their judgment,
&ldquo;the logical outcome of the past. Indians<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
must be enabled, in so far as they attain responsibility,
to determine for themselves what they want done</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;... such limitations on powers as we are now
proposing are due only to the obvious fact that time is
necessary in order to train both representatives and
electorates for the work which we desire them to
undertake; and that we offer Indians opportunities at
short intervals to prove the progress they are making
and to make good their claim, not by the method of
agitation but by positive demonstration, to the further
stages in self-government which we have just indicated.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>That is the only basis on which they maintain they
can hope to see in India &ldquo;the growth of a conscious
feeling of organic unity with the Empire as a whole.&rdquo;
With these and a few more prefatory remarks about
the educational problem and the attitude of the ryot
and the enunciation of the general principles on which
their proposals are based they proceed to formulate
their scheme, starting first with the provinces.</p>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>The proposals relating to Provincial Government
may be noticed under the following heads:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Financial devolution</i>: It is proposed that henceforth
there should be a complete separation of the
provincial finances from those of the Government of
India; that, reserving certain sources of revenue for
the Government of India, all others should be made
over to the Provincial Governments with the proviso
that the first charge on all Provincial revenues will be
a contribution towards the maintenance of the Government
of India, considered necessary and demanded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
by the latter. A certain amount of power to impose
fresh taxes and to raise loans is also conceded to the
provincial Governments subject to the veto of the
Government of India.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Legislative devolution</i>: &ldquo;It is our intention,&rdquo;
say the authors of the report, &ldquo;to reserve to the Government
of India a general overriding power of legislation
for the discharge of all functions which it will have to
perform. It should be enabled under this power to
intervene in any province for the protection and
enforcement of the interests for which it is responsible;
to legislate on any provincial matter in respect of
which uniformity of legislation is desirable, either for
the whole of India or for any two or more provinces;
and to pass legislation which may be adopted either
<i>simpliciter</i> or with modifications by any province
which may wish to make use of it. We think that the
Government of India must be the sole judge of the
propriety of any legislation which it may undertake
under any one of these categories, and that its competence
so to legislate should not be open to challenge
in the courts. Subject to these reservations we intend
that within the field which may be marked off for
provincial legislative control the sole legislative power
shall rest with the provincial legislatures.&rdquo; It is not
proposed to put a statutory limitation on the power
of the Government of India to legislate for the
provinces, but it is hoped that &ldquo;constitutional practice&rdquo;
will prevent the central Government interfering in
provincial matters unless the interests for which the
latter is responsible are directly affected.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Provincial Executive</i>: Article 220 gives the
Governor the power to appoint &ldquo;one or two additional<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
members of his Government as members without
portfolio for purposes of consultation and advice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These, in substance, are the proposals of the Secretary
of State and the Government of India for the
future government of the provinces into which India
is divided. Some of these latter and some other
tracts are expressly excluded from the operation of
these recommendations. It will be at once observed
that this is neither autonomy nor home rule. It is a
kind of hybrid system with final powers of veto and
control vested in the Government of India. The
provision as to Provincial Legislatures make it still
more complicated.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Let us now explain how we contemplate in future
that the executive Governments of the provinces
shall be constituted. As we have seen, three provinces
are now governed by a Governor and an Executive
Council of three members, of whom one is in practice
an Indian and two are usually appointed from the
Indian Civil Service, although the law says only that
they must be qualified by twelve years&rsquo; service under
the Crown in India. One province, Bihar and Orissa,
is administered by a Lieutenant-Governor with a
council of three constituted in the same way. The
remaining five provinces, that is to say, the three
Lieutenant-Governorships of the United Provinces,
the Punjab and Burma and the Chief Commissionerships
of the Central Provinces and Assam are under
the administration of a single official Head. We
find throughout India a very general desire for the
extension of Council government.... Our first
proposition, therefore, is that in all these provinces
singleheaded administration must cease and be replaced
by collective administration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In determining the structure of the Executive
we have to bear in mind the duties with which it will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
be charged. We start with the two postulates; the
complete responsibility for the government cannot be
given immediately without inviting a breakdown,
and that some responsibility must be given at once if
our scheme is to have any value. We have defined
responsibility as consisting primarily in amenability
to constituents, and in the second place in amenability
to an assembly. We do not believe that there is any
way of satisfying these governing conditions other
than by making a division of the functions of the
Government, between those which may be made over
to popular control and those which for the present
must remain in official hands.... We may call
these the &lsquo;reserved&rsquo; and &lsquo;transferred&rsquo; subjects respectively.
It then follows that for the management of
these two categories there must be some form of
executive body, with a legislative organ in harmony
with it....</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>&ldquo;We propose therefore that in each province the
executive Government should consist of two parts.
One part would comprise the head of the province
and an executive council of two members. In all
provinces the head of the Government would be
known as Governor.... One of the two Executive
Councillors would in practice be a European qualified
by long official experience, and the other would be an
Indian. It has been urged that the latter should be
an elected member of the provincial legislative council.
It is unreasonable that choice should be so limited.
It should be open to the Governor to recommend
whom he wishes.... The Governor in council
would have charge of the reserved subjects. The
other part of the government would consist of one
member or more than one member, according to the
number and importance of the transferred subjects,
chosen by the Governor from the elected members of
the Legislative council. They would be known as
ministers. They would be members of the executive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
Government but not members of the Executive Council;
they would be appointed for the life-time of the
legislative council, and if reelected to that body would
be re-eligible for appointment as members of the
Executive. As we have said, they would not hold
office at the will of the legislature but at that of their
constituents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The portfolios dealing with the transferred subjects
would be committed to the ministers, and on
these subjects the ministers together with the Governor
would form the administration. On such subjects
their decision would be final, subject only to the
Governor&rsquo;s advice and control. We do not contemplate
that from the outset the Governor should
occupy the position of a purely constitutional Governor
who is bound to accept the decisions of his ministers.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>Provincial Legislatures</i>: &ldquo;We propose there
shall be in each province an enlarged legislative
council, differing in size and composition from province
to province, with a substantial elected majority,
elected by direct election on a broad franchise, with
such communal and special representation as may be
necessary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The questions of franchise and special and communal
representation have been entrusted to a special
committee the report of which is shortly expected.
The same committee will also decide how many official
members there will be on each Legislative Council.
It is provided that the Governor shall be the President
of the Council and will have the power to nominate a
Vice-president from the official members. As to the
effect of resolutions it is said that &ldquo;we do not propose
that resolutions, whether on reserved or transferred
subjects should be binding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The classification of the reserved and transferred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
subjects was also left to a special committee which has
since concluded its labours and whose report is awaited
with interest.</p>

<p><i>Legislation on reserved subjects</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;For the purpose of enabling the provincial Government
to get through its legislation on reserved subjects,
we propose that the head of the Government should
have power to certify that a Bill dealing with a reserved
subject is a measure &lsquo;essential to the discharge of his
responsibility for the peace or tranquillity of the
province or of any part thereof, or for the discharge of
his responsibility for the reserved subjects.&rsquo;... The
Bill will be read and its general principles discussed
in the full legislative council. It will at this stage be
open to the council by a majority vote to request the
Governor to refer to the Government of India, whose
decision on the point shall be final, on the question
whether the certified Bill deals with a reserved subject.
If no such reference is made, or if the Government of
India decide that the certificate has been properly
given, the Bill will then be automatically referred to a
Grand Committee of the council. Its composition
should reproduce as nearly as possible the proportion of
the various elements in the larger body ... the grand
committee in every council should be constituted so
as to comprise from 40 to 50 per cent. of its strength.
It should be chosen for each Bill, partly by election by
ballot, and partly by nomination. The Governor
should have power to nominate a bare majority exclusive
of himself. Of the members so nominated
not more than two-thirds should be officials, and the
elected element should be elected <i>ad hoc</i> by the elected
members of the council on the system of the transferable
vote.&rdquo;</p></div>


<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;On reference to the grand committee, the Bill
will be debated by that body in the ordinary course,
if necessary referred to a select committee, to which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
body we think that the grand committee should have
power to appoint any member of the legislative council
whether a member of the grand committee or not.
The select committee will, as at present, have power
to take evidence. Then, after being debated in the
grand committee and modified as may be determined,
the Bill will be reported to the whole council. The
council will have the right to discuss the Bill again
generally, but will not be able to reject it, or to amend
it except on the motion of a member of the executive
council. The Governor will then appoint a time
limit within which the Bill may be debated in the
council, and on its expiry it will pass automatically.
But during such discussion the council will have the
right to pass a resolution recording any objection
which refers to the principle or details of the measure
(but not, of course, to the certificate of its character),
and any such resolution will accompany the Act when,
after being signed by the Governor, it is submitted to
the Governor General and the Secretary of State.&rdquo;</p></div>


<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Provincial Budget</i>: &ldquo;... the provincial budget should
be framed by the executive Government as a whole.
The first charge on provincial revenues will be the
contribution to the Government of India; and after
that the supply for the reserved subjects will have
priority. The allocation of supply for the transferred
subjects will be decided by the ministers. If the
revenue is insufficient for their needs, the question of
new taxation will be decided by the Governor and the
ministers. We are bound to recognise that in time
new taxation will be necessary, for no conceivable
economies can finance the new developments which
are to be anticipated. The budget will then be laid
before the council which will discuss it and vote by
resolution upon the allotments. If the legislative
council rejects or modifies the proposed allotment for
reserved subjects, the Governor should have power to
insist on the whole or any part of the allotment originally
provided, if for reasons to be stated he certifies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
its necessity in the terms which we have already
suggested. We are emphatically of opinion that the
Governor in Council must be empowered to obtain
the supply which he declares to be necessary for the
discharge of his responsibilities. Except in so far as
the Governor exercises this power the budget would
be altered in accordance with the resolutions carried
in council.&rdquo;</p></div>


<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Modification of the Scheme by the Government of India.</i>
&ldquo;After five years&rsquo; time from the first meeting of the
reformed councils we suggest that the Government of
India should hear applications from either the provincial
Government or the provincial council for the
modification of the reserved and transferred lists of
the province; and that, after considering the evidence
laid before them, they should recommend for the
approval of the Secretary of State the transfer of
such further subjects to the transferred list as they
think desirable. On the other hand, if it should be
made plain to them that certain functions have been
seriously maladministered, it will be open to them,
with the sanction of the Secretary of State, to retransfer
subjects from the transferred to the reserved list, or
to place restrictions for the future on the minister&rsquo;s
powers in respect of certain transferred subjects....
But it is also desirable to complete the responsibility
of the ministers for the transferred subjects. This
should come in one of two ways, either at the initiative
of the council if it desires and is prepared to exercise
greater control over the ministers, or at the discretion
of the Government of India, which may wish to make
this change as a condition of the grant of new, or of
the maintainance of existing, powers. We propose,
therefore, that the Government of India may, when
hearing such applications, direct that the ministers&rsquo;
salaries, instead of any longer being treated as a
reserved subject, and, therefore, protected in the last
resort by the Governor&rsquo;s order from interference should
be specifically voted each year by the legislative council;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
or, failing such direction by the Government of India,
it should be open to the councils at that time or subsequently
to demand by resolution that such ministers&rsquo;
salaries should be so voted, and the Government of
India should thereupon give effect to such request.&rdquo;</p></div>


<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Periodic commissions</i>: ... Ten years after the first
meeting of the new councils established under the
Statute a commission should be appointed to review
the position. Criticism has been expressed in the
past of the composition of Royal Commissions, and it
is our intention that the commission which we suggest
should be regarded as authoritative and should derive
its authority from Parliament itself. The names of
the commissioners, therefore, should be submitted by
the Secretary of State to both Houses of Parliament for
approval by resolution. The commissioners&rsquo; mandate
should be to consider whether by the end of the term
of the legislature then in existence it would be possible
to establish complete responsible government in any
province or provinces, or how far it would be possible
to approximate it in others; to advise on the continued
reservation of any departments for the transfer of
which to popular control it has been proved to their
satisfaction that the time had not yet come; to recommend
the retransfer of other matters to the control
of the Governor in Council if serious maladministration
were established; and to make any recommendations
for the working of responsible government or the
improvement of the constitutional machinery which
experience of the systems in operation may show to be
desirable....</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are several other important matters, germane
in greater or less degree to our main purpose, which the
commission should review. They should investigate
the progress made in admitting Indians into the higher
ranks of the public service. They should examine
the apportionment of the financial burden of India
with a view to adjusting it more fairly between the
provinces. The commission should also examine the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
development of education among the people and the
progress and working of local self-governing bodies.
Lastly the commission should consider the working of
the franchise and the constitution of electorates,
including the important matter of the retention of
communal representation. Indeed, we regard the
development of a broad franchise as the arch on which
the edifice of self-government must be raised; for we
have no intention that our reforms should result
merely in the transfer of powers from a bureaucracy to
an oligarchy....&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In proposing the appointment of a commission ten
years after the new Act takes effect we wish to guard
against possible misunderstanding. We would not
be taken as implying that there can be established by
that time complete responsible government in the
provinces. In many of the provinces no such consummation
can follow in the time named. The pace
will be everywhere unequal, though progress in one
province will always stimulate progress elsewhere;
but undue expectations might be aroused, if we indicated
any opinion as to the degree of approximation
to complete self-government that might be reached
even in one or two of the most advanced provinces.
The reasons that make complete responsibility at
present impossible are likely to continue operative in
some degree even after a decade.&rdquo;</p></div>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>The proposals regarding the Government of India
called the Central Government may be thus summed
up:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(<i>a</i>) <i>General</i>: &ldquo;We have already made our opinion
clear that pending the development of responsible
government in the provinces the Government of India
must remain responsible only to Parliament. In
other words, in all matters which it judges to be essen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>tial
to the discharge of its responsibilities for peace,
order, and good government it must, saving only for
its accountability to Parliament, retain indisputable
power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>The Governor General&rsquo;s Executive Council</i>:
&ldquo;We would therefore abolish such statutory restrictions
as now exist in respect of the appointment of
Members of the Governor General&rsquo;s Council, so as to
give greater elasticity both in respect to the size of
the Government and the distribution of work.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>At present there is one Indian member in the
Viceroy&rsquo;s Executive Council consisting of six ordinary
members and one extraordinary besides the Viceroy.
This scheme recommends the appointment of another
Indian.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>The Indian Legislative Council</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I. Legislative Assembly: &ldquo;We recommend therefore
that the strength of the legislative council, to be known
in future as the Legislative Assembly of India, should
be raised to a total strength of about 100 members, so
as to be far more truly representative of British India.
We propose that two-thirds of this total should be
returned by election; and that one-third should be
nominated by the Governor General, of which third
not less than a third again should be non-officials
selected with the object of representing minority or
special interests.... Some special representation,
we think, there must be, as for European and Indian
commerce, and also for the large landlords. There
should be also communal representation for Muhammadans
in most provinces and also for Sikhs in the
Punjab.&rdquo;</p>

<p>II. The Council of State: &ldquo;We do not propose to
institute a complete bi-cameral system, but to create
a second chamber, known as the Council of State,
which shall take its part in ordinary legislative business
and shall be the final legislative authority in matters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
which the government regards as essential. The
Council of State will be composed of 50 members,
exclusive of the Governor General, who would be
President, with power to appoint a Vice-President who
would normally take his place: not more than 25 will
be officials, including the members of the executive
council, and 4 would be non-officials nominated by the
Governor General. Official members would be eligible
for nomination to both the Legislative Assembly and
the Council of State. There would be 21 elected
members of whom 15 will be returned by the non-official
members of the provincial legislative councils,
each council returning two members, other than those
of Burma, the Central Provinces and Assam which
will return one member each....</p>

<p>&ldquo;Inasmuch as the Council of State will be the
supreme legislative authority for India on all crucial
questions and also the revising authority upon all
Indian legislation, we desire to attract to it the services
of the best men available in the country. We desire
that the Council of State should develop something
of the experience and dignity of a body of Elder Statesmen;
and we suggest therefore that the Governor
General in Council should make regulations as to the
qualification of candidates for election to that body
which will ensure that their status and position and
record of services will give to the Council a senatorial
character, and the qualities usually regarded as appropriate
to a revising chamber.&rdquo;</p>

<p>III. Legislative procedure: &ldquo;Let us now explain
how this legislative machinery will work. It will
make for clearness to deal separately with Government
Bills and Bills introduced by non-official members.
A Government Bill will ordinarily be introduced and
carried through all the usual stages in the Legislative
Assembly. It will then go in the ordinary course to
the Council of State, and if there amended in any
way which the Assembly is not willing to accept, it
will be submitted to a joint session of both Houses,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
by whose decision its ultimate fate will be decided.
This will be the ordinary course of legislation. But
it might well happen that amendments made by the
Council of State were such as to be essential in the
view of the Government if the purpose with which the
Bill was originally introduced was to be achieved, and
in this case the Governor General in Council would
certify that the amendments were essential to the
interests of peace, order, or good government. The
assembly would then not have power to reject or
modify these amendments, nor would they be open
to revision in a joint session.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have to provide for two other possibilities.
Cases may occur in which the Legislative Assembly
refuses leave to the introduction of a Bill or throws
out a Bill which the Government regarded as necessary.
For such a contingency we would provide that if leave
to introduce a Government Bill is refused, or if the Bill
is thrown out at any stage, the Government should
have the power, on the certificate of the Governor
General in Council that the Bill is essential to the
interests of peace, order, or good government, to refer
it <i>de novo</i> to the Council of State; and if the Bill, after
being taken in all its stages through the Council of
State, was passed by that body, it would become law
without further reference to the Assembly. Further,
there may be cases when the consideration of a measure
by both chambers would take too long if the emergency
which called for the measure is to be met. Such a
contingency should rarely arise; but we advise that in
cases of emergency, so certified by the Governor
General in Council, it should be open to the Government
to introduce a Bill in the Council of State, and
upon its being passed there merely to report it to the
Assembly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>IV. Powers of dissolution, etc.: &ldquo;The Governor
General should in our opinion have power at any time
to dissolve either the Legislative Assembly or the
Council of State or both these bodies. It is perhaps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
unnecessary to add that the Governor General and the
Secretary of State should retain their existing powers
of assent, reservation, and disallowance to all Acts of
the Indian legislature. The present powers of the
Governor General in Council under section 71 of the
Government of India Act. 1915, to make regulations
proposed by local Governments for the peace and
good government of backward tracts of territory
should also be preserved; with the modification that
it will in future rest with the Head of the province
concerned to propose such regulations to the Government
of India.&rdquo;</p>

<p>V. Fiscal legislation: &ldquo;Fiscal legislation will, of
course, be subject to the procedure which we have
recommended in respect of Government Bills. The
budget will be introduced in the Legislative Assembly
but the Assembly will not vote it. Resolutions upon
budget matters and upon all other questions, whether
moved in the Assembly or in the Council of State, will
continue to be advisory in character.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(d) Privy Council: &ldquo;We have a further recommendation
to make. We would ask that His Majesty
may be graciously pleased to approve the institution
of a Privy Council for India.... The Privy Council&rsquo;s
office would be to advise the Governor General when
he saw fit to consult it on questions of policy and
administration.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(e) Periodic commissions: &ldquo;At the end of the last
chapter we recommended that ten years after the
institution of our reforms, and again at intervals of
twelve years thereafter, a commission approved by
Parliament should investigate the working of the
changes introduced into the provinces, and recommend
as to their further progress. It should be equally the
duty of the commission to examine and report upon
the new constitution of the Government of India, with
particular reference to the working of the machinery
for representation, the procedure by certificate, and
the results of joint sessions.&rdquo;</p></div>

<h4>III</h4>

<h4><span class="smcap">India Office in London</span></h4>

<p>The principal proposals under this head may be thus
summarized;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;We advise that the Secretary of State&rsquo;s salary,
like that of all other Ministers of the Crown, should
be defrayed from home revenues and voted annually
by Parliament. This will enable any live questions
of Indian administration to be discussed by the House
of Commons in Committee of Supply.... It might
be thought to follow that the whole charges of the
India Office establishment should similarly be transferred
to the home Exchequer; but this matter is
complicated by a series of past transactions, and by
the amount of agency work which the India Office does
on behalf of the Government of India; and we advise
that our proposed committee upon the India Office
organization should examine it and taking these factors
into consideration, determine which of the various
India Office charges should be so transferred, and
which can legitimately be retained as a burden on
Indian revenues.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the transfer of charges which we propose,
although it will give reality to the debates on Indian
affairs, will not ensure in Parliament a better informed
or a more sustained interest in India. We feel that
this result can only be accomplished by appointing a
Select Committee of Parliament on Indian affairs.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>The above in substance is the proposed scheme.
In India it has met with varied response. The European
community does not approve of it. They think
it is too radical. The European Services have struck
a note of rebellion threatening to resign in case of its
acceptance by Parliament. The Indian politicians<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
are divided into two camps. Their views are best
represented by the following tabular statement which
we reproduce from the Indian newspapers.</p>

the necessities or drawbacks of

having regard to the terms of
the announcement of August
20, 1917, and in order that the
progress of India towards the
goal of a self-governing unit of
the British Empire may be
facilitated and not unduly delayed
or hampered, as also with
a view to avoid the untoward
consequences of a legislature
containing a substantially elected
popular element being allowed
merely to indulge in criticism
unchecked by responsibility, it
is essential that the principle of
responsible government&rsquo; should
be introduced also in the Government
of India, simultaneously
with a similar reform in the
provinces. There should, therefore,
be a division of functions in
the Central Government into
&lsquo;reserved&rsquo; and &lsquo;transferred&rsquo; as a
part of the present instalment of
reforms and the Committee on
division of functions should be
instructed to investigate the
subject and make recommendations.<br />
<br />
 &nbsp; &nbsp; (b) While, as suggested
above, some measures of transfer
of power to the Indian Legislature
should be introduced at the
commencement, provision should
be made for future progress
towards complete responsible
government of the Government
of India by specifically authorizing
the proposed periodic Commissions
to inquire into the
matter and to recommend to
Parliament such further advance
as may be deemed necessary
or desirable in that behalf.<br />
<br />
 &nbsp; &nbsp; (c) The power of certification
given to the Governor-General
should be limited to matters
involving the defence of the
country&rsquo;s foreign and political
relations, and peace and order
and should not be extended to
&lsquo;good government&rsquo; generally or
&lsquo;sound financial administration.&rsquo;<br />

that the composition of
the Council of State should be so
altered as to ensure that one half

It will be easily seen that Indian opinion, of both
Hindus and Mussulmans, is substantially in accord in
their demands for the democratization of the Central
government and in their criticism of the rest of the
scheme. The Indians have thus exercised their right

what they ask for is only a modest instalment of

INDIA&rsquo;S CLAIM TO FISCAL AUTONOMY
&ldquo;INDUSTRIES AND TARIFFS&rdquo;</h2>

<p>I beg to record my strong opinion that
in the matter of Indian industries we are
bound to consider Indian interests firstly,
secondly, and thirdly. I mean by &ldquo;firstly&rdquo;
that the local raw products should be utilised,

<p>Economic bondage is the worst of all bondages.
Economic dependence, or the lack of economic independence,
is the source of all misery, individual or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
national. A person economically dependent upon
another is a virtual slave, despite appearances. He
who supplies food and raiment and the necessities of
life is the real master.</p>

<p>The desire for gain dominates the world and all its
activities. Even religion, as ordinarily understood,
interpreted and administered, is a game of pounds
and shillings, say what one may to the contrary.
There are exceptions to this statement, but they are
few and far between. The world does not subsist by
bread alone, but without bread it cannot exist even
for a minute. The generality of the world cares more
for bread than for anything else, though there are
individuals and groups of individuals who would not
stoop to obtain bread by dishonorable means and
those also who would die rather than obtain bread by
the violation of their soul.</p>

<p>There are numerous ways in which a subject nation
feels the humiliation and helplessness of her position,
but none is so telling and so effective as the subordination
of her economic interests to those of the dominant
power. This is especially true in these days of free
and easy transportation, of quick journeys, and of
scientific warfare. In any struggle between nations,
the victory eventually must rest with the one in
possession of the largest number of &ldquo;silver bullets.&rdquo;
It is true that silver bullets alone will not do unless
there are brains and bodies to use them, but the latter
without the former are helpless.</p>

<p>A nation may be the greatest producer of food;
yet she may die of hunger from lack of ability to keep
her own produce for herself. Food obeys the behest
of the silver bullets. The law of self-preservation,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
therefore, requires only that nations be free to regulate
their own household, subject to the condition that
thereby they do not violate the rules of humanity or
trample upon the rights of any human being.</p>

<p>Mr. Montagu and Lord Chelmsford have, in parts
of their Report, been extremely candid. The value of
their joint production lies in this candidness. In no
other part, perhaps, have they been so candid as in
the one dealing with &ldquo;Industries and Tariff.&rdquo; In
Paragraph 331 they frankly admit the truth of the
following observation of the late Mr. Ranade on the
economic effects of British rule in India:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;The political domination of one country by another
attracts far more attention than the more formidable,
though more unfelt, domination which the capital,
enterprise and skill of one country exercise over the
trade and manufactures of another. This latter
domination has an insidious influence which paralyses
the springs of all the various activities which together
make up the life of a nation.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>In the course of a letter addressed to the <i>Westminster
Gazette</i> in 1917, Lord Curzon said that &ldquo;the fiscal
policy of India during the last thirty or forty years
has been shaped far more in Manchester than in
Calcutta.&rdquo; This candid admission about &ldquo;the subordination
of Indian fiscal policy to the Secretary of
State and a House of Commons powerfully affected
by Lancashire influence,&rdquo; is the keynote of the Indian
demand for Home Rule. The authors of the Montagu-Chelmsford
Report say so quite frankly and fairly in
Paragraphs 332 to 336 of their report, from which we
make the following extracts:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;The people are poor; and their poverty raises the
question whether the general level of well-being could
not be materially raised by the development of industries.
It is also clear that the lack of outlet for
educated youth is a serious misfortune which has
contributed not a little in the past to political unrest
in Bengal. But perhaps an even greater mischief is
the discontent aroused in the minds of those who are
jealous for India by seeing that she is so largely dependent
on foreign countries for manufactured goods.
They noted that her foreign trade was always growing,
but they also saw that its leading feature continued
to be the barter of raw materials valued at relatively
low prices for imported manufactures, which obviously
afforded profits and prosperity to other countries
industrially more advanced. Patriotic Indians might
well ask themselves why these profits should not accrue
to their country: and also why so large a portion of
the industries which flourished in the country was
financed by European capital and managed by European
skill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fact that India&rsquo;s foreign trade was largely
with the United Kingdom gave rise to a suspicion that
her industrial backwardness was positively encouraged
in the interests of British manufactures, and the
maintenance of the excise duty on locally manufactured
cotton goods in the alleged interests of Lancashire is
very widely accepted as a conclusive proof of such a
purpose. On a smaller scale, the maintenance of a
Stores Department at the India Office is looked upon
as an encouragement to the Government to patronize
British at the expense of local manufacturers.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>There can thus be no autonomy without fiscal
autonomy. In fact, the latter alone is the determining
characteristic of an autonomous existence.</p>

<p>The one national trait which distinguishes the
British from other nations of the world is their habit
of truthfulness and frankness. When we say that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
we do not thereby mean that all Britishers are equally
truthful&mdash;to the same extent and degree. But we
do mean that on the whole the British nation has a
larger percentage of truthful and candid persons in
her family than any other nation on the face of the
earth. Where their interests clash with those of
others, they can be as hard, exacting and cruel as any
one else in the world. But repentance overtakes
them sooner than it does the others. They have a
queer but admirable faculty of introspection which
few other people possess to the same extent and in
the same numbers. This is what endears them even
to those who are never tired of cursing their snobbishness
and masterful imperialism. The faculty of
occasionally seeing themselves with the eyes of others,
makes them the most successful <i>rulers of men</i>. They
are as a nation lacking in imagination, but there are
individuals amongst them who can see, if they will,
their own faults; who can and do speak out their
minds honestly and truthfully, even though by so
doing they may temporarily earn odium and unpopularity.</p>

<p>The remarks and observations of the eminent
authors of the Report relating to the fiscal relations
of India and England reflect the honesty of their
purpose and the sincerity of their mind as no other
part of the Report does. They have entered upon the
subject with great diffidence and, though expressing
themselves with marked candor and fairness, have
refrained from making any definite recommendations.</p>

<p>In this respect it will be only fair to acknowledge the
equally candid opinion of Mr. Austin Chamberlain,
who, in 1917, made a most significant confession by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
stating on an important occasion that &ldquo;India will not
remain, and ought not to remain content to be a hewer
of wood and a drawer of water for the rest of the
Empire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To our simple minds, not accustomed to the anomalies
of official life, it seems inexplicable how, after
these candid admissions, the authors could have any
hesitation in recommending the only remedy by which
India&rsquo;s wrong could be righted and her economic
rights secured in the future&mdash;viz., fiscal autonomy.</p>

<p>In Paragraph 335 the authors of the report give the
genesis of the Swadeshi boycott movement of 1905,
and very pertinently observe that &ldquo;in Japanese progress
and efficiency&rdquo; the educated Indians see &ldquo;an example
of what could be effected by an Asiatic nation free of
foreign control,&rdquo; or in other words, of what could be
achieved by India, if she had a national government
of her own interested in her industrial advance. Mr.
Montagu and Lord Chelmsford thus rightly observe
that &ldquo;English theories to the appropriate limits of the
State&rsquo;s activity are inapplicable in India&rdquo; and that if
the resources of the country are to be developed the
Government must take action.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After the war,&rdquo; add the authors, &ldquo;the need for
industrial development will be all the greater unless
India is to become a mere dumping-ground for the
manufactures of foreign nations which will then be
competing all the more keenly for the markets on
which their political strength so perceptibly depends.
India will certainly consider herself entitled to claim
all the help that her Government can give her to
enable her to take her place as a manufacturing country;
and unless the claim is admitted it will surely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
turn into an insistent request for a tariff which will
penalize imported articles without respect of origin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Further on the Report states:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;We are agreed therefore that there must be a
definite change of view; and that the Government
must admit and shoulder its responsibility for furthering
the industrial development of the country. The
difficulties by this time are well-known. In the past,
and partly as a result of recent <i>swadeshi</i> experiences,
India&rsquo;s capital has not generally been readily available;
among some communities at least there is apparent
distaste for practical training, and a comparative
weakness of mutual trust; <i>skilled labour is lacking</i>,
and although <i>labour is plentiful, education is needed to
inculcate a higher standard of living and so to secure a
continuous supply; there is a dearth of technical institutions;
there is also a want of practical information about
the commercial potentialities of India&rsquo;s war products</i>.
Though these are serious difficulties, they are not
insuperable; but they will be overcome only if the
State comes forward boldly as guide and helper. On
the other hand, there are good grounds for hope.
India has great natural resources, mineral and vegetable.
She has furnished supplies of manganese,
tungsten, mica, jute, copra, lac, etc., for use in the
war. She has abundant coal, even if its geographical
distribution is uneven; she has also in her large rivers
ample means of creating water-power. There is good
reason for believing that she will greatly increase her
output of oil. Her forest wealth is immense, and
much of it only awaits the introduction of modern
means of transportation, a bolder investment of
capital, and the employment of extra staff; while the
patient and laborious work of conservation that has
been steadily proceeding joined with modern scientific
methods of improving supplies and increasing output,
will yield a rich harvest in the future. We have been
assured that Indian capital will be forthcoming once<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
it is realized that it can be invested with security and
profit in India; a purpose that will be furthered by
the provision of increased facilities for banking and
credit. Labor, though abundant, is handicapped by
still pursuing uneconomical methods, and its output
would be greatly increased by the extended use of
machinery. We have no doubt that there is an
immense scope for the application of scientific methods.
Conditions are ripe for the development of new and
for the revival of old industries, and the real enthusiasm
for industries which is not confined to the ambitions
of a few individuals but rests on the general
desire to see Indian capital and labour applied jointly
to the good of the country, seem to us the happiest
augury.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>The views of educated India about fiscal policy have
been very faithfully reproduced in Paragraphs 341 and
342, which also we reproduce almost bodily:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Connected intimately with the matter of industries
is the question of the Indian tariff. This subject was
excluded from the deliberations of the Industrial Commission
now sitting because it was not desirable at
that juncture to raise any question of the modification
of India&rsquo;s fiscal policy; but its exclusion was none the
less the object of some legitimate criticism in India.
The changes which we propose in the Government of
India will still leave the settlement of India&rsquo;s tariff in
the hands of a government amenable to Parliament
and the Secretary of State; but inasmuch as the tariff
reacts on many matters which will henceforth come
more and more under Indian control, we think it well
that we should put forward for the information of His
Majesty&rsquo;s Government the views of educated Indians
upon this subject. We have no immediate proposals
to make; we are anxious merely that any decisions
which may hereafter be taken should be taken with
full appreciation of educated Indian opinion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The theoretical free trader, we believe, hardly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
exists in India at present. As was shown by the
debates in the Indian Legislative Council in March,
1913, educated Indian opinion ardently desires a tariff.
It rightly wishes to find another substantial basis than
that of the land for Indian revenues, and it turns to a
tariff to provide one. Desiring industries which will
give him Indian-made clothes to wear and Indian-made
articles to use, the educated Indian looks to the
example of other countries which have relied on tariffs,
and seizes on the admission of even free traders that
for the nourishment of nascent industries a tariff is
permissible. We do not know whether he pauses to
reflect that these industries will be largely financed by
foreign capital attracted by the tariff, although we
have evidence that he has not learned to appreciate
the advantages of foreign capital. But whatever
economic fallacy underlies his reasoning, these are his
firm beliefs; and though he may be willing to concede
the possibility that he is wrong, he will not readily
concede that it is our business to decide the matter
for him. He believes that as long as we continue to
decide for him we shall decide in the interests of England
and not according to his wishes; and he points
to the debate in the House of Commons on the differentiation
of the cotton excise in support of his contention.
So long as the people who refuse India
protection are interested in manufactures with which
India might compete, Indian opinion cannot bring
itself to believe that the refusal is disinterested or
dictated by care for the best interests of India. This
real and keen desire for fiscal autonomy does not
mean that educated opinion in India is unmindful of
Imperial obligations....&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>These admissions should put India&rsquo;s claims for
fiscal autonomy beyond the range of doubt and dispute,
but so strange are the ways of modern statesmanship
that consistency and logic are not the necessary
accompaniments thereof.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>The authors have advanced another very strong
argument for the economic development of India, viz.,
&ldquo;military value,&rdquo; which makes the case conclusive.
This argument has been supplied by the Great War
and is so well known that we need not state it in their
words.</p>

<p>If India is to prosper and take her legitimate place
in the British Commonwealth, and in the great family
of Nations of the World, it is absolutely necessary that
she should be given complete fiscal freedom to manage
her own affairs, develop her own industries and do her
own trading. Considering her size and resources, it
wounds her self-respect and makes her feel exceedingly
mean and small to go begging for alms and charity
every time there is a failure of rains and the cry of
famine is raised.</p>

<p>For a nation of 315 millions of human beings living
in a country which nature has endowed with all its
choicest blessings, rich and fertile soil, plenty of water
and sun, an abundant supply of metals and coal,
willing labor, artistic skill and a power of manipulating
for beauty and elegance unexcelled in the world&mdash;to
exist in pitiful economic dependence is a condition
most deplorable and most pathetic. We want no
charity, no concessions, no favors, no preference.
What we most earnestly beg and ask for is an <i>opportunity</i>.</p>

THE REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT</h2>


<p>In December, 1917, the Government of India
appointed a committee of three Englishmen and two
Indians (1) &ldquo;to investigate and report on the nature
and extent of the criminal conspiracies connected
with the revolutionary movements in India, (2) to
examine and consider the difficulties that have arisen
in dealing with such conspiracies and to advise as to
the legislation, if any, necessary to enable the government
to deal effectively with them.&rdquo; Of the three
English members, Mr. Justice Rowlatt of the King&rsquo;s
Bench Division, England, was appointed as president,
and of the other two, one was a judge in the service of
the Government and the other a member of a Board
of Revenue in one of the Indian Provinces. Of the
two Indians, one was a judge and the other a practicing
lawyer.</p>

<p>This committee submitted its report in April, 1918,
which was published by the Government of India in
July of the same year. The president, Mr. Justice
Rowlatt&rsquo;s letter covering the report gives the nature
of the evidence upon which their report is based,
which is as follows: &ldquo;Statements have been placed
before us with documentary evidence by the Governments
of Bengal, Bombay, Bihar and Orissa, the
Central Provinces, the United Provinces, the Punjab<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
and Burmah as well as by the Government of India.
In every case, except that of Madras, we were further
attended by officers of the government, presenting
this statement, who gave evidence before us. In the
two provinces in which we held sittings, namely,
Bengal and Punjab, we further invited and secured
the attendance of individuals, or as deputed by associations,
of gentlemen who we thought might give us
information from various non-official points of view.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is clear from this statement that the investigation
of the committee was neither judicial nor even semi-judicial;
it was a purely administrative inquiry conducted
behind the backs of the individuals concerned,
without the latter having any opportunity of cross-examining
the witnesses or giving their explanations
of the evidence against them. While the different
Governments in India were fully represented in each
case by the ablest of their servants, the individuals
investigated were not. We do not want to insinuate
that either the Governments or the officers deputed
by them were unfair in their evidence. All that we
want to point out is that the other side had no opportunity
of putting their case before the committee.
Consequently, it is no wonder that one comes across
many traces of political and racial bias both in the
introduction and the Report.</p>

<p>The very first paragraph of the introduction betrays
either ignorance on the part of the committee about
the ancient history of India, or a deliberate misrepresentation
of the nature of the Hindu State. The
committee says: &ldquo;Republican or Parliamentary forms
of governments as at present understood were neither
desired nor known in India until after the establish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>ment
of British rule. In the Hindu State the form of
government was an absolute monarchy, though the
monarch was by the Hindu Shastras hedged round by
elaborate rules for securing the welfare of his subjects
and was assisted by a body of councillors, the chief of
whom were Brahmin members of the priestly class
which derived authority from a time when the priests
were the sole repositories of knowledge and therefore
the natural instruments of administration.&rdquo; The
statements made in this paragraph do not represent
the whole truth.</p>

<p>The committee ignores the fact that Republican
or Parliamentary forms of Government &ldquo;<i>as at present
understood</i>&rdquo; were neither desired nor known in any
part of the world, except perhaps England itself until
<i>after</i> the establishment of British rule in India.<a name="FNanchor_1_27" id="FNanchor_1_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_27" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Then
the committee has altogether ignored that, in the
Hindu State, the form of government was not an
absolute monarchy <i>always and in all parts of India</i>.
There is ample historical evidence to prove that India
had many Republican States, along with oligarchies
and monarchies at one and the same period of her
history. The second part of the second sentence is
also not correct, because the priestly class derived its
authority from a time when the priests were not the
sole repositories of knowledge. The several Hindu
political treatises belong to a period when the whole
populace was highly educated and could take substantial
part in the determination of the affairs of their
country.</p>

<p>Equally misleading is the last sentence of the introduction
where the committee says that it is among the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>Chitpavan Brahmins of the Poona district that they
first find indications of a revolutionary movement.
This statement is incorrect, if it means that after the
establishment of British rule in India no attempt had
been made to overthrow it prior to the Revolutionary
movement inaugurated by the Poona Brahmins. The
statement ignores three such attempts which are
known to history; viz., (<i>a</i>) the great Mutiny of 1857,
(<i>b</i>) the Wah&aacute;bee Rebellion of Bengal, and (<i>c</i>) the
K&uacute;k&aacute; Rebellion of the Punjab; not to mention other
minor attempts made in other places by other people.</p>

<p>Yet we think that this report is a very valuable
document, giving in one place the history and the
progress of the Revolutionary Movement in India.
The findings and the recommendations of the committee
may not be all correct, but the material collected
and published for the first time is too valuable to be
neglected by anyone who wants to have an intelligent
grasp of the political situation in India, such as has
developed within the last twenty years.</p>

<p>The committee gives a summary of its conclusions
as to the conspiracies in Chapter XV, which we copy
verbatim:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;In Bombay they have been purely Brahmin and
mostly Chitpavan. In Bengal the conspirators have
been young men belonging to the educated middle
classes. Their propaganda has been elaborate, persistent
and ingenious. In their own province it has
produced a long series of murders and robberies. In
Bihar and Orissa, the United Provinces, the Central
Provinces and Madras, it took no root, but occasionally
led to crime and disorder. In the Punjab the return
of emigrants from America, bent on revolution and
bloodshed, produced numerous outrages and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
<i>Ghadr</i> conspiracy of 1915. In Burma, too, the <i>Ghadr</i>
movement was active, but was arrested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Finally came a Mohammedan conspiracy confined
to a small clique of fanatics and designed to overthrow
British rule with foreign aid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All these plots have been directed towards one
and the same objective, the overthrow by force of
British rule in India. Sometimes they have been
isolated; sometimes they have been interconnected;
sometimes they have been encouraged and supported
by German influence. All have been successfully
encountered with the support of Indian loyalty.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>In this general summary the committee has made
no attempt to trace out the causes that led to the
inauguration of the revolutionary movement and its
subsequent progress. A chapter on that subject would
have been most illuminating.</p>

<p>In chapters dealing with provinces they have selected
some individuals and classes on whom to lay blame
for &ldquo;incitements&rdquo; to murders and crimes, but have
entirely failed to analyze the social, political and
economic conditions which made such incitements and
their success possible.</p>

<p>It is clear even from this summary that the only
two provinces where the revolutionary propaganda
took root and resulted in more than occasional outrages
were Bengal and the Punjab.</p>

<p>In the Bombay Presidency, revolutionary outrages
did not exceed three within a period of 20 years (from
1897 to 1917), two murders and one bomb-throwing.
Besides, three trials for conspiracies are mentioned all
within a year (1909-1910), two in Native States and
one in British territory. Altogether 82 men were
prosecuted for being involved in these conspiracies.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
The total result comes to this, that in the course of
20 years about 100 persons were found to be involved
in a revolutionary movement in a territory embracing
an area of 186,923 square miles and a population of
27 million human beings. This is surely by no means
a formidable record justifying extraordinary legislation
such as is proposed.<a name="FNanchor_1_28" id="FNanchor_1_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_28" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The net loss of human life did
not exceed three, though unfortunately all three
victims were Europeans.</p>

<p>Bihar and Orissa formed part of the province of
Bengal during most of the period covered by the
revolutionary movement of Bengal, viz., from 1906
to 1917. It was in Bihar which was then a part of
Bengal, that in 1908, the first bomb was thrown.
The only other revolutionary outrage that took place
in Bihar was one in 1913, resulting in the murder of
two Indians.</p>

<p>In the United Provinces of Agra and Oude, the
only tangible evidence of revolutionary activity recorded
by the committee is the Benares Conspiracy
that came to light in 1915-1916. The only outrage
noted is that of the alleged murder of a fellow revolutionary
by a member of the same gang.</p>

<p>To the Central provinces the committee has given
a practically clean bill.</p>

<p>In Madras the revolutionary outrages consisted of
one murder (of a European Magistrate) and one
conspiracy involving nine persons.</p>

<p>The conspiracies and intrigues detected in Burma
are ascribed to people of other provinces and not a
single outrage from that province itself is reported.</p>

<p>So we find that in the period from 1906 to 1907,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
both inclusive, outside the provinces of Bengal and
the Punjab, the revolutionary crime was limited to
three outrages and three conspiracies in the Bombay
Presidency, one outrage in Bihar, one outrage and one
conspiracy in the United Provinces, one outrage and
one conspiracy in Madras and some intrigues and
conspiracies during the war in Burma. Thus the
only two provinces in which the revolutionary movement
established itself to any appreciable extent was
Bengal and the Punjab.</p>

<p>In the Punjab, again, the first revolutionary crime
took place in December, 1912, and the second in 1913
and the rest all during the War. Cases of seditious
utterances and writings are not included in the term
&ldquo;revolutionary crime&rdquo; used in the above paragraphs.
It was from Bengal, then, that before the War revolutionary
propaganda was carried on to any large extent,
revolutionary movements organized and revolutionary
crimes committed. About half of the Report deals
with Bengal and the general findings of the committee
may be thus summarized:</p>

<p>(1) That the object of the movement was the
overturning of &ldquo;the British government in India by
violent means&rdquo; (p. 15 and also p. 19).</p>

<p>(2) That the class among whom the movement
spread was comprised of the <i>Bhadralok</i> (the respectable
middle class). The committee says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;The people among whom he (i.e., Barendra, the
first Bengali revolutionary propagandist) worked, the
<i>bhadralok</i> of Bengal, have been for centuries peaceful
and unwarlike, but, through the influence of the great
central city of Calcutta, were early in appreciating
the advantages of Western learning. They are mainly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
Hindus and their leading castes are Brahmins, Kayasthas
and Vaidyas; but with the spread of English
education some other castes too have adopted <i>bhadralok</i>
ideals and modes of life. <i>Bhadralok</i> abound in villages
as well as in towns, and are thus more interwoven with
the landed classes than are the literate Indians of other
provinces. Wherever they live or settle, they earnestly
desire and often provide English education for their
sons. The consequence is that a number of Anglo-vernacular
schools, largely maintained by private
enterprise, have sprung up throughout the towns and
villages of Bengal. No other province of India
possesses a network of rural schools in which English
is taught. These schools are due to the enterprise of
the <i>bhadralok</i> and to the fact that, as British rule
gradually spread from Bengal over Northern India,
the scope of employment for English-educated Bengalis
spread with it. Originally they predominated in all
offices and higher grade schools throughout Upper
India. They were also, with the Parsees, the first
Indians to send their sons to England for education,
to qualify for the Bar, or to compete for the higher
grades of the Civil and Medical services. When,
however, similar classes in other provinces also acquired
a working knowledge of English, the field for Bengali
enterprise gradually shrank. In their own province
<i>bhadralok</i> still almost monopolize the clerical and
subordinate administrative services of Government.
They are prominent in medicine, in teaching and at
the Bar. But, in spite of these advantages, they have
felt the shrinkage of foreign employment; and as the
education which they receive is generally literary and
ill-adapted to incline the youthful mind to industrial,
commercial or agricultural pursuits, they have not
succeeded in finding fresh outlets for their energies.
Their hold on land, too, has weakened, owing to increasing
pressure of population and excessive sub-infeudation.
<i>Altogether their economic prospects have narrowed, and
the increasing numbers who draw fixed incomes have
felt the pinch of rising prices. On the other hand, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
memories and associations of their earlier prosperity,
combined with growing contact with Western ideas and
standards of comfort, have raised their expectations of
the pecuniary remuneration which should reward a laborious
and, to their minds, a costly education.</i> Thus as
<i>bhadralok</i> learned in English have become more and
more numerous, a growing number have become less
and less inclined to accept the conditions of life in
which they found themselves on reaching manhood.
<i>Bhadralok</i> have always been prominent among the
supporters of Indian political movements; and their
leaders have watched with careful attention events in
the world outside India. The large majority of the
people of Bengal are not <i>bhadralok</i> but cultivators,
and in the eastern districts mainly Muhammadans;
but the cultivators of the province are absorbed in
their own pursuits, in litigation, and in religious and
caste observances. It was not to them but to his own
class that Barendra appealed. When he renewed
his efforts in 1904, the thoughts of many members of
this class had been stirred by various powerful influences.&rdquo;
[The italics are ours.]</p></div>

<p>We have given this lengthy extract as it shows conclusively
(<i>a</i>) that the movement originated and spread
among people who had received Western education,
most of the leaders having been educated in England
and (<i>b</i>) that the root cause of the movement was
<i>economic</i>.</p>

<p>(3) That various circumstances occasioned by certain
Government measures &ldquo;specially favored the development&rdquo;
of the movement (p. 16). Among the measures
specially mentioned are (<i>a</i>) the University law of Lord
Curzon &ldquo;which was interpreted by politicians as
designed to limit the numbers of Indians educated in
English and thus to retard national advance&rdquo;; (<i>b</i>) the
partition of Bengal by Lord Curzon. &ldquo;It was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
agitation that attended and followed on this measure
that brought previous discontent to a climax.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(4) That the revolutionary movement received a
substantial impetus by the failure of constitutional
agitation for the reversal of the policy that decided
on partitioning Bengal into two divisions. This
failure led to two different kinds of agitation, open
and secret: (<i>a</i>) open economic defiance by <i>Swadeshi</i>
and boycott&mdash;<i>Swadeshi</i> was the affirmative and
boycott the negative form of the same movement.
<i>Swadeshi</i> enjoined the use of country made articles;
boycott was directed against English imports, (<i>b</i>) open
propaganda by a more outspoken and in some instances
violent press, (<i>c</i>) open control of educational agencies
by means of national institutions, (<i>d</i>) open stimulus
to physical education and physical culture, (<i>e</i>) nationalistic
interpretation of religious dogma and forms
(open), (<i>f</i>) organization of secret societies for more
violent propaganda, for learning and teaching the
use of firearms, for the manufacture of bombs, for
illicit purchase and stealing of firearms, for assassination
and murder, (<i>g</i>) secret attempts to tamper with
the army, (<i>h</i>) conspiracies for terroristic purposes and
for obtaining sinews of war by theft, robbery and
extortion.</p>

<p>The following two extracts which the committee
has taken from one of the publications of the revolutionary
party called <i>Mukti Kon Pathe</i> (what is the
path of salvation) will explain clauses (<i>f</i>) and (<i>g</i>) and
(<i>h</i>).</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;The book further points out that not much muscle
was required to shoot Europeans, that arms could be
procured by grim determination, and that weapons<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
could be prepared silently in some secret place. Indians
could be sent to foreign countries to learn the
art of making weapons. The assistance of Indian
soldiers must be obtained. They must be made to
understand the misery and wretchedness of the country.
The heroism of Sivaji must be remembered.
As long as revolutionary work remained in its infancy,
expenses could be met by subscriptions. But as work
advanced, money must be extracted from society by
the application of force. If the revolution is being
brought about for the welfare of society, then it is
perfectly just to collect money from society for that
purpose. It is admitted that theft and dacoity are
crimes because they violate the principle of good
society. But the political dacoit is aiming at the good
of society, &ldquo;so no sin but rather virtue attaches to the
destruction of this small good for the sake of some
higher good. Therefore if revolutionaries extort money
from the miserly or luxurious members of society by
the application of force, their conduct is perfectly
just.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Mukti Kon Pathe</i> further exhorts its readers to
obtain the &ldquo;help of the native soldiers.... Although
these soldiers for the sake of their stomach accept
service in the Government of the ruling power, still
they are nothing but men made of flesh and blood.
They, too, know (how) to think; when therefore the
revolutionaries explain to them the woes and miseries
of the country, they, in proper time, swell the ranks
of the revolutionaries with arms and weapons given
them by the ruling power.... Because it is possible
to persuade the soldiers in this way, the modern English
Raj of India does not allow the cunning Bengalis to
enter into the ranks of the army.... Aid in the shape
of arms may be secretly obtained by securing the help
of the foreign ruling powers.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>(5) That except in five cases the idea of private
gain never entered into the activities of the revolu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>tionaries
and of the five persons referred to three were
taxi-cab drivers either hired or coerced to co&ouml;perate
in revolutionary enterprise (p. 20).</p>

<p>(6) That &ldquo;the circumstances that robberies and
murders are being committed by young men of respectable
extraction, students at schools and colleges, is
indeed an amazing phenomenon the occurrence of
which in most countries would be hardly credible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(7) That &ldquo;since the year 1906 revolutionary outrages
in Bengal have numbered 210 and attempts at committing
such outrages have amounted to 101. Definite
information is in the hands of the police of the complicity
of no less than 1038 persons in these offences.
But of these, only 84 persons have been convicted of
specified crimes in 39 prosecutions, and of these persons,
30 were tried by tribunals constituted under the
Defence of India Act. Ten attempts have been made
to strike at revolutionary conspiracies by means of
prosecutions directed against groups or branches. In
these prosecutions 192 persons were involved, 63 of
whom were convicted. Eighty-two revolutionaries
have rendered themselves liable to be bound over to be
of good behaviour under the preventive sections of
the Criminal Procedure Code. In regard to 51 of
these, there is direct evidence of complicity in outrages.
There have, moreover, been 59 prosecutions under the
Arms and Explosives Acts which have resulted in
convictions of 58 persons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We wish the committee had also supplemented this
information by a complete record of the punishments
that were imposed on persons convicted of revolutionary
crime in the ten years from 1906 to 1917.
We are sure such a statement would have been most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
informing and illuminating. It would have conclusively
established the soundness of the half-hearted
finding that &ldquo;the convictions ... did not have as
much effect as might have been expected in repressing
crime.&rdquo; In fact they had no effect. They only added
fuel to the fire.</p>

<p>(8) That persons involved in revolutionary crime
belonged to all castes and occupations and the vast
bulk of them were non-Brahmins. They were of all
ages, from 10-15 to over 45, the majority being under
25. The committee has in an appendix (p. 93) given
three tables of statistics as to age, caste, occupation
or profession of persons convicted in Bengal of revolutionary
crimes or killed in commission of such crimes
during the years 1907-1917. This clause is based on
these statistics.</p>

<p>We are afraid, however, that these statistics do not
afford quite a correct index of the age, caste, occupation
and position of all the people in Bengal that were
and are sympathetically interested in the revolutionary
movement of Bengal.</p>

<p>In investigating reasons for failure of ordinary
machinery for the prevention, detection and punishment
of crime in Bengal, the committee has assigned
six reasons: (<i>a</i>) want of evidence, (<i>b</i>) paucity of
police, (<i>c</i>) facilities enjoyed by criminals, (<i>d</i>) difficulty
in proof of possession of arms, etc., (<i>e</i>) distrust of
evidence, (<i>f</i>) the uselessness, in general, of confession
made to the Police. These reasons, however, do
not represent the whole truth. Some of the most
daring crimes were committed in broad daylight, in
much frequented streets of the metropolis and in the
presence of numerous people. Moreover, the Govern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>ment
did not depend on ordinary law. Measure after
measure was enacted to expedite and facilitate convictions.
Extraordinary provisions were made to
meet all the difficulties pointed out by the committee
and extraordinary sentences were given in the case of
conviction. Yet the Government failed either to
extirpate the movement or to check it effectively or to
bring the majority of offenders to book.</p>

<p>The members of the committee have frankly admitted:
&ldquo;That we do not expect very much from
punitive measures. The conviction of offenders will
never check such a movement as that which grew up
in Bengal unless the leaders can be convicted at the
outset.&rdquo; They pin their faith on &ldquo;preventive&rdquo;
measures recommended by them. It was perhaps not
within their scope to say that the most effective preventive
measure was the removal of the political and
economic causes that had generated the movement.
The committee has studiously avoided discussing that
important point, but now and then they have incidentally
furnished the real clue to the situation.
Discussing the &ldquo;accessibility of Bengal schools and
colleges to Revolutionary influences,&rdquo; they quote a
passage from one of the reports of the Director of
Public Instruction in Bengal. We copy below the
whole of this paragraph, as, to us, it seems to be very
pertinent to the issue.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;<i>Accessibility of Bengal Schools and Colleges to
Revolutionary Influences.</i>&mdash;Abundant evidence has
compelled us to the conclusion that the secondary
English schools, and in a less degree the colleges, of
Bengal have been regarded by the revolutionaries
as their most fruitful recruiting centres. Dispersed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
as these schools are far and wide throughout the
Province, sometimes clustering in a town, sometimes
isolated in the far-away villages of the eastern water-country,
they form natural objects for attack; and as
is apparent from the reports of the Department of
Public Instruction, they have been attacked for years
with no small degree of success. In these reports the
Director has from time to time noticed such matters
as the circulation of seditious leaflets, the number of
students implicated in conspiracy cases and the apathy
of parents and guardians. But perhaps his most
instructive passages are the following, in which he sets
out the whole situation in regard to secondary English
schools. &lsquo;The number of these schools,&rsquo; he wrote, &lsquo;is
rapidly increasing, and the cry is for more and more.
It is a demand for tickets in a lottery, the prizes of which
are posts in Government service and employment in
certain professions. <i>The bhadralok have nothing to look
to but these posts</i>, while those who desire to rise from a
lower social or economic station have their eyes on
the same goal. <i>The middle classes in Bengal are generally
poor, and the increased stress of competition and
the tendency for the average earnings of certain careers to
decrease</i>&mdash;a tendency which is bound to follow on the
increased demand to enter them, <i>coupled with the rise
in the cost of living and the inevitable raising in the
standard of comfort&mdash;all these features continue to make
the struggle to exist in these classes keener</i>. Hence the
need to raise educational standards, to make school
life a greater influence for good and the course of
instruction more thorough and more comprehensive.
A need which becomes more and more imperative as
life in India becomes more complicated and more
exacting is confronted by a determined though perfectly
natural opposition to the raising of fees.... <i>Probably
the worst feature of the situation is the low wages and the
complete absence of prospects which are the fate of teachers
in the secondary schools....</i> It is easy to blame the
parents for blindness to their sons&rsquo; true good, but the
matriculation examination is the thing that seems to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
matter, so that if his boy passes the annual promotion
examinations and is duly presented at that examination
at the earliest possible date, the average parent has no
criticism to offer. This is perfectly natural, but the
future of Bengal depends to a not inconsiderable extent
on the work done in its secondary schools, and more
is required of these institutions than an ability to pass
a certain proportion of boys through the Calcutta
University Matriculation examination.... The present
condition of secondary schools is undoubtedly
prejudicing the development of the presidency and is
by no means a negligible feature in the existing state
of general disturbance. It is customary to trace the
genesis of much sedition and crime to the back streets
and lanes of Calcutta and Dacca, where the organizers
of anarchic conspiracies seek their agents from among
University students. This view is correct as far as it
goes, but it is in the high schools, with their underpaid
and discontented teachers, their crowded, dark and
ill-ventilated classrooms, and their soul-destroying
process of unceasing cram, that the seeds of discontent
and fanaticism are sown.&rdquo; [The italics are ours.]</p></div>

<p>Yet for years nothing was done to improve education,
to make it practical and creative and productive.
In fact nothing has been done up till now.</p>

<p>Let the reader read with this the report of the
Indian Industrial Commission recently issued under
the authority of the Government of India and he will
at once find the true causes which underlie the revolutionary
movement in India. These causes are not in
any way peculiar to Bengal or to the Punjab; they are
common to the whole of India, but they have found a
fruitful soil in these provinces on account of the rather
intense natures of the people of these two provinces.
The Bengali is an intensely patriotic and emotional
being, very sensitive and very resentful; the Punjabee<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
is intensely virile, passionate and plucky, having
developed a strong, forceful character by centuries of
resistance to all kind of invasions and attacks. Of the
Punjab, however, we will speak later on. For the
present we are concerned with Bengal only. The
amazing phenomenon mentioned by the committee
on p. 20 and referred to by us before is easily explained
by the facts hinted in the Directors&rsquo; report quoted
above. And this notwithstanding the fact that in the
matter of Government patronage Bengal has been the
most favored province in India, throughout the period
of British rule. To the Bengalis have gone all the first
appointments to offices that were thrown open to the
natives of the soil. They have been the recipients of
the highest honors from the Government. Bengal is
virtually the only province permanently settled where
the Government cannot add to the Land tax fixed in
1793. The Bengalis are the people who spread over
India, with every territorial extension of the British
Raj. They have been the pampered and favored
children of the Government and for very good reasons,
too. They are the best educated and the most intelligent
of all the Indian peoples. They know how
to adapt themselves to all conditions and circumstances,
they know how to enjoy and also how to suffer. They
have subtle brains and supple bodies. The British
Government could not do without them. It cannot
do without them even now. Yet it was this most
loyal and most dutiful, this most westernized and the
best educated class which laid the foundations of the
revolutionary movement and has been carrying it
on <i>successfully</i> in face of all the forces of such a
mighty Government as that of the British in India.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
What is the reason? It is the utter economic helplessness
of the younger generation, aided by a sense of
extreme humiliation and degradation. The Government
never earnestly applied itself to the solution of
the problem. They did nothing to reduce poverty
and make education practical. Every time the
budget was discussed the Indian members pressed for
increased expenditure on education. All their proposals
and motions were rejected by the standing
official majorities backed by the whole force of non-official
Europeans including the missionaries. The
Government thus deliberately sowed the wind. Is
there any wonder that it is now reaping the whirlwind?</p>

<p>The cause is economic; the remedy must be economic.
Make education practical, foster industries, open all
Government careers to the sons of the soil, reduce the
cost on the military and civil services, let the people
determine the fiscal policy of the country and the
revolutionary movement will subside. Die it will not,
so long as there is foreign domination and foreign
exploitation. Even after India has attained Home
Rule it will not die. It has come to stay. India is
a part of the world and revolution is in the air all
the world over. The effort to kill it by repression
and suppression is futile, unwise and stupid.</p>

THE PUNJAB</h2>


<p>We may now consider the case of the Punjab.
Lord Morley&rsquo;s verdict notwithstanding, it is abundantly
clear that the troubles of 1907, with which the history
of unrest in the Punjab begins, were principally
agrarian in their origin. Lord Morley&rsquo;s speech in
the House of Commons (in 1907) as to the root of the
trouble was based on reports supplied to him by the
Government of the Punjab and we know from personal
knowledge how unreliable many of these reports are.
We may here illustrate this point by a few extracts
from these documents.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(1) Lord Morley stated that: &ldquo;There were twenty-eight
meetings known to have been held by the leading
agitators in the Punjab between 1st March and 1st
May. Of these five only related, even ostensibly,
to agricultural grievances; the remaining twenty-three
were all purely political.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>The number of meetings held from March 1 to May
1, 1907 was, at the lowest calculation, at least double
of 28, or perhaps treble, and <i>most of them</i> related &ldquo;even
ostensibly to agricultural grievances&rdquo;; the number of
purely political meetings could not have exceeded ten
or twelve.</p>

<p>(2) On p. 61 the committee writes that &ldquo;Chatarji<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>&rsquo;s
father too had ordered him home on discovering that
he was staying with Hardayal in the house of Lajpat
Rai.&rdquo; The whole of this statement is absolutely false.
I am prepared to swear and to prove that Chatarji did
not stay in my house even for a single night. He
came there a few times with Hardayal. Hardayal
was at that time living in a house he had rented for
himself in the native city about one mile from my
place which is in the Civil Station on the Lower
Mall.</p>

<p>On the same page the committee has approvingly
quoted a sentence from the judgment of the Sessions
Judge in the Delhi Conspiracy Case. Speaking of
Amir Chand, one of the accused in that case who was
sentenced to death, the Sessions Judge describes him
as &ldquo;one who spent his life in furthering murderous
schemes which he was too timid to carry out himself.&rdquo;
Now I happen to have known this man for about
20 years before his conviction. I have no doubt that
he was rightly convicted in this case but I have no
doubt also that this description of him by the Sessions
Judge was absolutely wrong. Up till 1910 the man
had led an absolutely harmless life, helping students
in their studies and otherwise rendering assistance,
according to his means, to other needy people. No
one ever credited him with violent views. His revolutionary
career began in 1908. Before that he could
not and would not have tolerated even the killing of
an ant, much less that of human beings.</p>

<p>In governments by bureaucracies one of the standing
formulas of official etiquette is never to question the
findings of facts arrived at by your superiors or predecessors.
This naturally leads to the perpetuation of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
mistakes. A wrong conclusion once accepted continues
to be good for all times to come. The Rowlatt Committee
has studiously acted on that formula throughout
its present inquiry. They have invariably accepted
the findings of executive and judicial authorities
preceding them about the incidents that happened
since 1907, without making any independent inquiry
of their own. Hence their opinion about the original
or the principal cause of the unrest of 1907 in the
Punjab is not entitled to greater weight than that of
the Punjab officials whose mishandling of the affairs
of the province produced the unrest. One ounce of
fact, however, is of greater weight in the determination
of issues than even a hundred theories. The fact that
the Government of India <i>had</i> to veto the Punjab
Government&rsquo;s Land Colonies Act in order to allay the
unrest proves conclusively that the unrest was due to
agrarian trouble.</p>

<p>The unrest of 1907 subsided after the repeal of the
land legislation of 1907, but the legacy it left is still
operative.</p>

<p>The Sikhs and the Mussulmans of the Punjab, as
well as the military classes among the Hindus, the
Rajputs and the Jats, are the most virile portions of
the population. They have fought the battles of the
Empire. In the interests of the Empire they have
travelled far and wide. Yet we find that educationally,
as well as economically, they have suffered most.
They have the largest numbers of illiterates among
them. They are the least developed and the least
progressive of all the classes in the Punjab. They
are heavily in debt. The Government has occasionally
recognised it and has tried to satisfy them by pref<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>erential
treatment in the filling of Government posts,
or in the bestowal of titles or in nominating their
supposed leaders to Legislative Councils. These ridiculous
palliative measures, however, have failed in their
objective. The classes disaffected do not get any
satisfaction by these palliative measures. They need
opportunities of education and economic betterment.
These could not be provided without making education
general and without a more equitable distribution of
land among the agricultural classes and the inauguration
of industries other than agriculture. This the
Government never cared to do. The Sikhs and the
Mussulmans naturally directed their attention to
emigration.</p>

<p>The opportunities they found in other parts of the
Empire whetted their appetites. They compared the
conditions abroad with conditions at home and drew
their own conclusions. Having helped in the expansion
and development of the Empire they thought
they were entitled to benefit therefrom. They demanded
fair treatment. Instead they found the doors
shut upon them. Even those that had been admitted
were made to feel the humiliation of their position.
Deliberate, active, concerted measures were taken to
drive them away or to make life for them intolerable.
Their wives and children were refused admittance and
various pretexts were invented to keep them out or to
drive them away. The revolutionary movement in
the Punjab amounted to nothing until it was reinforced
by the return of the Sikh members of the Ghadr
party during the war. The Committee has failed to
answer the question: Why did the Sikhs of Vancouver
and California readily fall in with the schemes of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
Hardayal and Barkat Ullah, the alleged founders of
the revolutionary party of California? These latter
had nothing in common with the Sikhs. In language
and religion, by habits and associations, they were
poles apart from each other. Why did then Hardayal&rsquo;s
propaganda find such a ready soil among the Sikhs of
Vancouver B. C. We quote from the report:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;The doctrines which he preached and circulated
had reached the Sikhs and other Indians resident in
British Columbia. At a meeting in Vancouver in
December, 1913, a poem from the Ghadr newspaper
was read, in which the Hindus were urged to expel the
British from India. The main grievance of the Vancouver
Indians was the Canadian immigration law
under which every intending Asiatic immigrant, with
a few particular exceptions, has to satisfy the Canadian
authorities that he is in possession of 200 dollars and
has travelled by a <i>continuous</i><a name="FNanchor_1_29" id="FNanchor_1_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_29" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> journey on a through
ticket from his native country to Canada. In 1913
three Sikh delegates visited the Punjab. They had
come from America and were members of the Ghadr
party who had come to reconnoitre the position.
Their real purpose was recognised after their departure.
They addressed meetings at various towns on the
subject of the grievances of Indians in Canada and
caused resolutions of protest to be passed in which all
communities joined.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Again, tracing the origin of the Budge-Budge riot,
the Committee remarks:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;The central figure in the narrative is a certain
Gurdit Singh, a Sikh of the Amritsar district in the
Punjab, who had emigrated from India 15 years before,
and had for some time carried on business as a con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>tractor
in Singapore and the Malay States. There is
reason to believe that he returned to this country about
1909. He was certainly absent from Singapore for a
space; and when he returned there, going on to Hong
Kong, he interested himself in chartering a ship for
the conveyance of Punjabis to Canada. Punjabis,
and especially Sikhs, frequently seek employment in
the Far East, and have for some time been tempted
by the higher wages procurable in Canada. But their
admission to that country is to some extent impeded
by the immigration laws which we have described
already.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There were already in Canada about 4,000 Indians,
chiefly Punjabis. Some of these were revolutionists of
the Hardayal school, some were loyal, and some had
migrated from the United States on account of labour
differences there. The Committee of Enquiry, which
subsequently investigated the whole affair, considered
that Gurdit Singh&rsquo;s action had been much influenced
by advice and encouragement received from Indian
residents in Canada. At any rate, after failing to
secure a ship at Calcutta, he chartered a Japanese
vessel named the <i>Komagata Maru</i> through a German
agent at Hong Kong. He issued tickets and took in
passengers at that post, at Shanghai, at Moji and at
Yokohama. He certainly knew what the Canadian
law was, but perhaps hoped to evade it by means of
some appeal to the courts or by exercising political
pressure. It is equally certain that many of his passengers
had no clear comprehension of their prospects.
The Tribunal that subsequently tried the first batch
of Lahore conspirators held that probably Gurdit
Singh&rsquo;s main object was to cause an inflammatory
episode, as one of the witnesses stated that Gurdit
Singh told his followers that should they be refused
admission, they would return to India to expel the
British. On April the 4th, 1914, the <i>Komagata
Maru</i> sailed from Hong Kong. On the 23rd of May
the <i>Komagata Maru</i> arrived at Vancouver with 351
Sikhs and 21 Punjabi Muhammadans on board. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
local authorities refused to allow landing except in a
very few cases, as the immigrants had not complied
with the requirements of the law. Protests were
made, and, while negotiations were proceeding, a
balance of 22,000 dollars still due for the hire of the
ship was paid by Vancouver Indians, and the charter
was transferred to two prominent malcontents....
A body of police was sent to enforce the orders of the
Canadian Government that the vessel should leave;
but with the assistance of firearms, the police were
beaten off, and it was only when a Government vessel
was requisitioned with armed force that the <i>Komagata
Maru</i> passengers, who had prevented their Captain
from weighing anchor or getting up steam, were
brought to terms. On the 23rd of July they started
on their return journey with an ample stock of provisions
allowed them by the Canadian Government.
<i>They were by this time in a very bad temper as many had
staked all their possessions on this venture, and had
started in the full belief that the British Government would
assure and guarantee their admission to a land of plenty.</i>
This temper had been greatly aggravated by direct
revolutionary influences....</p>

<p>&ldquo;During the return voyage the War broke out.
On hearing at Yokohama that his ship&rsquo;s company
would not be allowed to land at Hong Kong, Gurdit
Singh replied that they were perfectly willing to go to
any port in India if provisions were supplied. The
British Consul at Yokohama declined to meet his
demands, which were exorbitant; but the consul at
Kobe was more compliant, and after telegraphic communication
between Japan and India, the <i>Komagata
Maru</i> started for Calcutta. At neither Hong Kong
nor Singapore were the passengers allowed to land.
This added to their annoyance, as, according to the
findings of the Committee, many had not wished to
return to India at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Committee found that most of the passengers
were disposed to blame the Government of India for
all their misfortunes. &ldquo;It is well known,&rdquo; states the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
Report, &ldquo;that the average Indian makes no distinction
between the Government of the United Kingdom,
that of Canada, and that of British India, or that of
any colony. To him these authorities are all one and
the same. And this view of the whole <i>Komagata Maru</i>
business was by no means confined to the passengers
on the ship. It inspired some Sikhs of the Punjab
with the idea that the Government was biased against
them; and it strengthened the hands of the Ghadr
revolutionaries who were urging Sikhs abroad to return
to India and join the mutiny which, they asserted,
was about to begin. Numbers of emigrants listened
to such calls and hastened back to India from Canada,
the United States, the Philippines, Hong Kong and
China.&rdquo; [The italics are ours.]</p></div>

<p>We have given this extract to show the real cause of
the growth of the revolutionary movement among the
Sikhs. Let the reader omit, if he can, for a moment,
all references to active revolutionary propaganda and
he will find that the underlying cause of this trouble
was <i>economic</i>. Why did the Sikhs want to emigrate
to Canada? Why did they stake all their possessions
on the venture? Why were they unwilling to return
to India at all? Because the economic conditions at
home were so bad and the prospects abroad so good.
At home their lands were not sufficient to absorb all
their energies, the income was not sufficient to keep
body and soul together and, in a majority of cases,
what they made from land was hardly more than
sufficient to pay Land Revenue to the Government
and interest to the money-lender. There was nothing
to bind them to their homes except the love of home
land and the domestic ties. These melted away in
the presence of dire necessity. In extreme need they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
left their homes to make more money to be able to
pay their debts, to redeem their lands, if possible to
purchase more land and to make life bearable and
tolerable. When they came in the open world they
found insurmountable barriers between them and
plenty. They had helped in making the empire;
the empire had enough land for all her sons and daughters;
men were urgently needed to bring land into
cultivation and otherwise to develop the empire; men
of other races and colours were not only welcome but
were being induced to come and settle by offers of all
kinds. They, and they alone, were unwelcome and
barred.</p>

<p>Add to this the attitude and the record of the Punjab
Government towards political agitation and political
agitators, to use their own favorite expressions. The
Punjab Government was the first to resuscitate the
old Regulation III of 1818 for the purpose of scotching
a legitimate agitation against an obnoxious legislative
measure. A wise and sagacious Government would
have dropped the legislation which it was eventually
found necessary to veto to maintain peace. The
deportations drove the seeds of unrest deeper. The
other contributory causes may be thus summed up:</p>

<p>(1) The Punjab Government has been the most
relentless of all local governments in India in suppressing
freedom of speech and press.</p>

<p>(2) The Punjab Government at one time was very
foolishly zealous in persecuting the Arya Samajists and
in making a mountain out of a molehill about the
letters found in the possession of Parmanand.</p>

<p>(3) The sentences which the Punjab Courts have
passed in cases of seditious libel are marked by such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
brutality as to make them notably unique in the
history of criminal administration in India.</p>

<p>(4) The strangulation of all open political life by
direct and indirect repression led to the adoption of
secret methods.</p>

<p>(5) The sentences passed in the Delhi Conspiracy
case were much more severe than those given in Bengal
in similar cases. In this case four men were hanged,
two of them only because of membership in the secret
conspiracy and not for actual participation in the
outrage that was the subject of the charge, and two
others were sentenced to seven years rigorous imprisonment
each.</p>

<p>(6) The Budge-Budge riot and the considerable loss
of life that resulted therefrom was another case of
stupid management and utter incapacity to handle a
delicate situation.</p>

<p>(7) For the Lahore Conspiracy 28 persons were
hanged, and about 90 sentenced to long terms of
imprisonment and transportation for life. But for
the interference of Lord Hardinge the hangings would
have exceeded 50. In addition some mutinous soldiers
of two regiments were tried by Court Martial and a
few murderous robbers and train-wreckers were dealt
with by the ordinary courts. The reader may well
compare this with the record of convictions relating
to Bengal.</p>

<p>Now, we have not the slightest intention of justifying
the conduct of those who conspired to overthrow the
Government by force, or who committed murders,
robberies or other offences in the furtherance of that
design. In our judgment only madmen, ignorant of
the conditions of their country, could have been guilty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
of such crimes. Nor are we inclined to blame the
Government much for the sharp steps they took to
preserve order and maintain their authority during
the war. But, after all has been said, we must reiterate
that the underlying causes were economic and were
the direct result of Government policy.</p>

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR REPRESSIVE
LEGISLATION</h2>


<p>The Committee has said all that it could against
individual publicists, Indian public movements and
the native press. They have found no fault with the
Anglo-Indian press and the Government. The whole
force of their judicial acumen has been applied in
recommending fresh measures of repression and
suppression which they have divided into two kinds:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Punitive Measures, Permanent, (<i>a</i>) Points of General
Application. The measures which we shall submit
are of two kinds, viz., Punitive, by which term
we mean measures better to secure the conviction and
punishment of offenders, and Preventive, i.e., measures
to check the spread of conspiracy and the commission
of crime.</p>

<p>We may say at once that we do not expect very
much from punitive measures.<a name="FNanchor_1_30" id="FNanchor_1_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_30" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The conviction of
offenders will never check such a movement as that
which grew up in Bengal unless all the leaders can be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
convicted at the outset. Further, the real difficulties
have been the scarcity of evidence due to various
causes and the want of reliance whether justified or
not, on such evidence as there has been. The last
difficulty is fundamental and cannot be remedied.
No law can direct a court to be convinced when it is
not.</p>


<p class="center">Punitive Measures (Permanent).</p>

<p>Legislation directed better to secure the punishment
of seditious crime may take the shape either&mdash;</p>

<p class="negidt">(<i>a</i>) of changes in the general law of evidence or
procedure which if sound would be advisable
in regard to all crime, or</p>

<p class="negidt">(<i>b</i>) changes in the substantive law of sedition or
modifications in the rules of evidence and
procedure in such cases designed to deal with
the special features of that class of offence.</p>
</div>

<p>The recommendation under (<i>a</i>) does not amount
to much and we will not mention it.</p>

<p>Under (<i>b</i>) they recommend:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In the first place we think that a permanent enactment
on the lines of Rule 25A under the Defence of
India Act is required. That rule provides for the
punishment of persons having prohibited documents
(which may have to be defined anew) in their possession
or control with (as we read the effect of the words
used) intent to publish or circulate them....</p>

<p>We also recommend that the principle of section 565
of the Code of Criminal Procedure (which provides
for an order requiring notification of residence after
release in the case of persons convicted a second time
for certain offences) should be extended to all persons
convicted of offences under Chapter VI of the Penal
Code (offences against the State) whether previously
convicted or not. Such persons might be ordered to
give security for a period not exceeding two years for
good behaviour so far as offences under Chapter VI<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
are concerned, and in default be directed to notify
their residence to Government, who should have power
to restrict their movements for the period of two years
after their release and prohibit them from addressing
public meetings,&mdash;the term &ldquo;public meetings&rdquo; including
in its scope political subjects as in section 4 of the
Prevention of Seditious Meetings Act of 1907.</p>

<p>Lastly, we think that in all cases where there is a
question of seditious intent, evidence of previous
conviction for seditious crime or association (of an
incriminating kind, of course) with persons so convicted
should be admissible upon written notice to the
accused with such particulars and at such a time
before the evidence is given as might be fair. What
we have called seditious crime would of course have
to be accurately defined.</p></div>

<p>Now it is evident that after such legislation all liberty
of speech and action becomes extinct. These recommendations
will we fear directly lead to secret propaganda
and secret action.</p>

<p>Under the head of emergency punitive measures the
committee recommends:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Emergency Provisions for Trials. Coming now to
the measures themselves, we are of opinion that
provision should be made for the trial of seditious
crime by Benches of three Judges without juries or
assessors and without preliminary commitment proceedings
or appeal. In short, the procedure we
recommend should follow the lines laid down in sections
5-9 inclusive of the Defence of India Act. It should
be made clear that section 512 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure (relating to the giving in evidence under
certain circumstances of depositions taken in the
absence of an absconding accused) applies to these
trials, it having, we understand, been questioned
whether section 7 of the Defence of India Act has that
effect.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>
<p>We think it necessary to exclude juries and assessors
mainly because of the terrorism to which they are
liable. But terrorism apart, we do not think that
they can be relied upon in this class of cases. They
are too much inclined to be affected by public discussion.</p></div>

<p>We omit the detailed discussion of these provisions
in which the committee has attempted to soften the
sting of these recommendations by giving their reasons
and by suggesting certain safeguards against their
abuse. The most startling of their recommendations
are however made under the head of emergency
preventive measures.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Emergency Preventive Measures. We have been
forced to the conclusion that it is necessary, in order
to keep the conspiracies already described under
control in the future, to provide for the continuance
after the expiry of the Defence of India Act (though in
the contingent form explained and under important
limitations) of some of the powers which that measure
introduced in a temporary form. By those means
alone has the conspiracy been paralysed for the present
and we are unable to devise any expedient operating
according to strict judicial forms which can be relied
upon to prevent its reviving to check it if it does
revive, or, in the last resort, to suppress it anew. This
will involve some infringement of the rules normally
safeguarding the liberty of the subject. We have
endeavored to make that infringement as small as we
think possible consistently with the production of an
effective scheme.</p>

<p>Existing Temporary Powers. The powers at present
temporarily possessed by the Government are so far
as material for the present purpose to be found in
rules 3-7 inclusive and 12A under the Defence of
India Act, 1915. We do not refer for the present to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
the Foreigners Ordinance, 1914, or the Ingress into
India Ordinance, 1914.... Shortly stated, their
effect is to give power to require persons by executive
order to remain in any area to be specified or not to
enter or remain in any such area, with penalties for
breach of such requirements. These orders may be
made and served on the person affected, whereupon
they become binding upon him, or the person may be
arrested without warrant and detained for a period
not exceeding in all one month, pending an order of
restriction. There is also a power of search under
search warrant. It will be observed there is no provision
for an examination of the cases of such persons.
The decision lies solely with the Local Government.
There is also the power of confinement under Regulation
III of 1818.</p></div>

<p>Again:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Two Grades of Powers Desirable.&mdash;We now
proceed to elaborate ... the scheme we suggest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We think, as we have already indicated, that the
powers to be acquired should be of two grades capable
of being called into operation separately, possibly
under different forms of notification.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first group of powers should be of the following
nature:&mdash;</p>

<p class="negidt">&ldquo;(i) to demand security with or without sureties;</p>

<p class="negidt">&ldquo;(ii) to restrict residence or to require notification of
change of residence;</p>

<p class="negidt">&ldquo;(iii) to require abstention from certain acts, such as
engaging in journalism, distributing leaflets
or attending meetings;</p>

<p class="negidt">&ldquo;(iv) to require that the person should periodically
report to the police.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The second group of powers should be&mdash;</p>

<p class="negidt">&ldquo;(i) to arrest;</p>

<p class="negidt">&ldquo;(ii) to search under warrant;</p>

<p class="negidt">&ldquo;(iii) to confine in non-penal custody.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;In Article 196 they provide &ldquo;that in respect of
acts committed before the Defence of India Act expires
(or an earlier date if preferred) and danger apprehended
by reason of such acts in the future it should be lawful
to proceed against any person under any of the provisions
which we have outlined without any notification.
In other words, the new law is to be deemed to
be operative for that purpose immediately.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Articles 198 and 199 suggest measures for restricting
&ldquo;Ingress into India&rdquo; and also for regulating and
restricting &ldquo;Inter-Provincial Movements.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Need it be said that if these recommendations are
accepted there will be no liberty of press or speech in
India and the Reform will fail to suppress the revolutionary
movement at all. Indian opinion is unanimous
in condemning these recommendations as has been
proved by the unanimous opposition of all sections of
Indians in the Viceroy&rsquo;s Legislative Council to the
bills that have been introduced to give effect to them.</p>

THE REVOLUTIONARY PARTY</h2>

<p class="squote">&ldquo;Causes and Aims of the War.&rdquo; Speech

with the freedom of that city, June 29,
1917.</p></div>


<p>The authors of the report remark:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;There exists a small revolutionary party deluded
by hatred of British rule and desire for the elimination
of the Englishman into the belief that the path to
independence or constitutional liberty lies through
anarchical crime. Now it may be that such persons
will see for themselves the wisdom of abandoning
methods which are as futile as criminal; though if
they do not, the powers of the law are or can be made
sufficient for the maintenance of order. But the
existence of such people is a warning against the
possible consequences of unrestrained agitation in
India. We are justified in calling on the political
leaders, in the work of education that they will undertake,
to bear carefully in mind the political inexperience
of their hearers; and to look for further progress not
to fiery agitation which may have consequences quite
beyond their grasp, but to the machinery which we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
devise for the purpose. In every country there will
be persons who love agitation for agitation&rsquo;s sake or
to whom it appeals like an intoxicant. It is the duty
of the leaders of Indian opinion to remember the effect
on people not accustomed to weighing words of fiery
and heated speeches. Where ignorance is widespread
and passions are so easily aroused, nothing is
easier than for political leaders to excite a storm;
nothing harder for them than to allay it. Breaches of
the peace or crimes of violence only put back the
political clock. Above all things, when the future of
India depends upon co-operation among all races,
attacks upon one race or religion or upon another
jeopardise the whole experiment. Nor can the condemnation
of extremist and revolutionary action be
left only to the official classes. We call upon all those
who claim to be leaders to condemn with us and to
support us in dealing with methods of agitation which
drive schoolboys to crime and lead to religious and
agrarian disturbance. Now that His Majesty&rsquo;s Government
have declared their policy, reasonable men
have something which they can oppose successfully to
the excitement created by attacks on Government and
by abuse of Englishmen, coupled with glowing and
inaccurate accounts of India&rsquo;s golden past and appeals
to race hatred in the name of religion. Many prominent
Indians dislike and fear such methods. A new
opportunity is now being offered to combat them;
and we expect them to take it. Disorder must be
prejudicial to the cause of progress and especially
disorder as a political weapon.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>We are in general agreement with the sentiments
expressed in this extract but we will be wanting in
candour if we fail to point out that, though the revolutionary
movement in India is mainly political, it is
partly economic and partly anarchic also. In the
first two aspects it is at present the product of purely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
local (Indian) conditions. In the last, it is the reaction
of world forces. While we are hoping that the change
in the policy, now announced, will remove the political
basis of it, we are not quite sure that that will ensure
the extermination of the party or the total destruction
of the movement. The growth of democratic political
institutions in India must inevitably be followed by a
movement for social democracy. The spirit of Revolution
which is now fed by political inequalities will,
when these are removed, find its sustenance in
social inequalities. That movement may not be anti-British;
perhaps it will not be, but that it will have
some revolutionary element in it may be assumed.
The lessons of history make it clear that the most
effective way to prevent its falling into channels of
violence is to have as little recourse to coercion as
may be consistent with the preservation of general
order and peace. The preservation of order and the
unhindered exercise of private rights by all citizens is
the pre-requisite condition to good government.
Every government must see to it. It is their duty to
use preventive as well as punitive methods. There
are, however, ways of doing these things. One is the
British, the American and the French way.<a name="FNanchor_1_31" id="FNanchor_1_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_31" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The
other is what was heretofore associated with the name
of the late Czar. The third is the German way. We
hope the lessons of Czarism will not be lost on either
party. The governments have as much to learn from
it as the peoples. The best guarantee against the
abnormal growth of a revolutionary movement is to
adopt and follow the British methods and to avoid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
scrupulously and without fail any approach to the
discredited Russian or Prussian methods.</p>

<p>The Indian soil and the Indian atmosphere are not
very congenial for revolutionary ideas and revolutionary
methods. The people are too docile, gentle,
law-abiding and spiritually inclined to take to them
readily. They are by nature and tradition neither
vindictive nor revengeful. Their general spirit is
opposed to all kinds of violence. They have little
faith in the virtues of force. Unless they are provoked,
and that too terribly, and are face to face with serious
danger they do not like the use of force, even when
recourse to it may be legal and morally defensible.</p>

<p>One of the causes of the growth of the revolutionary
movement in India has been the insolence and the
incivility of the European Community towards the
Indian Community. The charges of cowardice so
often hurled against the Bengali have played no
insignificant part in the genesis of the Bengal revolutionary.
The distinguished authors have put it
rather mildly:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;If there are Indians who really desire to see India
leave the empire, to get rid of English officers and
English commerce, we believe that among their springs
of action will be found the bitterness of feeling that
has been nurtured out of some manifestation that
the Englishman does not think the Indian an equal.
Very small seeds casually thrown may result in great
harvests of political calamity. We feel that, particularly
at the present stage of India&rsquo;s progress, it is
the plain duty of every Englishman and woman, official
and non-official, in India to avoid the offence
and the blunder of discourtesy: and none the less is it
incumbent on the educated Indian to cultivate patience<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
and a more generous view of what may very likely be
no more than heedlessness or difference of custom.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>We admire the dignified way in which they have
addressed their advice to the educated Indian. But
we hope they do not ignore that except in a few
scattered instances heretofore the chief fault has lain
with the ruling class. The proceedings of the Royal
Commission on the Public Services of India are full of
that racial swagger which the authors of this report
have mildly condemned in the above extract and it is
an open secret that that spirit was one of the dearly
cherished articles of faith with the bureaucracy. We
hope the war has effected a great change in their
temper and both parties will be disposed to profit
from the advice given to them in the report.</p>

<p>As to the duty of the educated leaders in the matter
of suppressing the growth of the revolutionary movement
in future, we beg to point out that all depends on
how much faith the governing classes place in the
professions of the popular leaders. Open public
speeches and meetings appealing to racial or religious
animosities have not played any important part in
the development of the revolutionary spirit. It is
not likely that the educated leaders will in any way
consciously and voluntarily digress from the limits of
reasonable criticism of Government policy, nor have
they very often done so in the past. What has so
far prevented the educated leaders from exercising an
effective check on the growth of the revolutionary
movement is their inability to associate on terms of
friendship with the younger generation. This has
been due partly to a false idea of dignity and partly
to the fear that any association with hot-headed young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
men might bring discredit on them or might land
them in hot water if, sometime or other, any one of
their friends might do anything violent. Public
speeches denouncing the revolutionary propaganda
and the revolutionary activities or public condemnation
of the latter in the press are good in their own way,
but they are not quite effective. The revolutionist
may ascribe it to fear, timidity, or hypocrisy. What
is needed is that educated leaders of influence should
be free to mix, socially and otherwise, with the younger
generation so as to acquire an intimate knowledge of
their trend of thought and bent of mind. It is in
these intimate exchanges of views that they can most
effectively exercise their powers of argument and
persuasion and use their influence effectively. They
will not succeed always, but in a good many cases they
will. This cannot be done, however, unless the
Executives and the Police relax their attentions toward
them.</p>

<p>The bureaucrats&rsquo; want of confidence in any Indian
leader reached its limit in the attentions which the
agents of the secret service bestowed on such men as
the late Mr. Gokhale. It is an open secret that the
secret service records have assigned a particular
number to every public leader in India. Religious
preachers and teachers of the type of Lala Hansraj
and Lala M&ucirc;nshi R&aacute;m receive as much attention in
the records as the writer of this book or Mr. B. G.
Tilak or Mr. Bepin Chandra Pal. The &ldquo;Servants of
India&rdquo; are as much the objects of solicitation on the
part of the secret service men as the members of the
Arya Samaj. Of course, agitators are agitators. All
the great progressive souls of the world have had to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
agitate at one time or another in their lives. Agitation
is the soul of democracy. There can be no progress
in a democracy without agitation. Sir Denzil Ibbetson
could pay no greater compliment to the Arya Samaj
than by his remark in 1907 that, according to his
information, wherever there was an Arya Samaj it
was a centre of unrest. We hope the Governments
are now convinced that the Arya Samaj has never been
revolutionary. It is one of the most conservative,
restraining forces in the social life of the country.
Yet it cannot be denied that its propaganda has been
and will continue to be one of the most disturbing
factors in the placid waters of Indian life. The
bureaucracy could not look upon it with kindness.
Any attempt to persist in this kind of control or check
or persecution will be fatal to the success of the appeal
which Mr. Montagu and Lord Chelmsford have
addressed to the public men of India in the extract
given above.</p>

<p>In our judgment the most effective way to check
the growth of the revolutionary movement is by
freeing the mind of the leaders of the fear of being
misunderstood if they should mix freely with the
younger generation and yet fail to prevent some of
them from becoming revolutionists. A revolutionary
prospers on exclusiveness. Secrecy is his great ally.
Cut off a young man from open, healthy influences and
he will be attracted by the mystery of secrecy. Thenceforth
he is doomed. After that he may be weaned
only by kindness and friendliness and not by threats
or persecution. Most of the youths attracted by
revolutionary propaganda have proved to be quite
ignorant of the real conditions of their country. No<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
attempt has been made to instruct them in politics.
They have been fed on unsound history and unsound
politics. Reactionary Imperialism has harmed them
more than exaggerated nationalism. They have had
few opportunities of discussion with people who could
look upon things in right perspective. They could
not open their minds to their European teachers.
In the few cases in which they did they repented.
Somehow or other, the free confidential talks they had
with their professors found an entry in the police
records. It brought a black mark against their
names, to stand and mar their careers forever. The
Indian teacher and professor is afraid of discussing
politics with them. So they go on unrestrained until
the glamour of prospective heroism, by a deed of
violence, fascinates one of them and he is led into
paths of crimes of a most detestable kind. Unscrupulous
advisors lead him toward falsehood, hypocrisy,
treachery, treason and crime by dubious methods.
One of the things they preach is that morality has
nothing to do with politics. They insinuate that the
violence of militarism and Imperialism can be effectively
met and checked only by violence. Poor
misguided souls! They enforce their advice by the
diplomatic history of Europe. They forget that once
a youth is led into the ways of falsehood and unscrupulousness
he may as easily use it against his friends as
against his enemies. If he has no scruples about killing
an enemy he may have none about killing a friend.
If he has no scruples about betraying the one, he may
have none about betraying the other. Once a man
starts toward moral degeneration, even for desirable
or patriotic ends, there is no knowing whither his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
course might take him. The most idealistic young
men starting with the highest and purest conceptions
of patriotism have been known to fall into the most
ignoble methods of attacking first their enemies and
then their friends. When they reach that stage of
moral corruption they can trust no one, can believe in
the honesty of no one. Their one idea of cleverness
and efficiency is to conceal their motives from everyone,
to give their confidence to no one, to suspect and
distrust everyone and to aspire toward the success
that consists in imposing upon all.</p>

<p>The remedy against this lies in encouraging an open
and frank discussion of politics on the part of the
younger generation, with such indulgences as are due to
their youth and immaturity of judgment; a systematic
teaching of political history in schools and colleges;
a free and open intercourse with their teachers on the
clearest understanding that nothing said in discussion
or in confidence will ever be used either privately or
publicly against them, and an equally free and intimate
intercourse with the leaders of thought and of public
life in the country. These latter must be freed from
the attentions of the secret service if it is intended that
they should effectually co&ouml;perate in counteracting
revolutionary propaganda. Besides, the younger generation
must be brought up in habits of manly and
open encounter with their adversaries, in a spirit of
sport and fair play. Repression, suppression, and
suspicion do not provide a congenial climate for the
development of these habits and they should be
subordinated as much as possible in the present condition
of chaotic conflict between social interests and
social ideals.</p>

EDUCATION</h2>


<p>In the previous chapters we have embodied and
discussed the important parts of the Report of Mr.
Montagu and Lord Chelmsford. In this chapter we
give a summary of what they say about education.
The statements of fact made by the two distinguished
statesmen are so lucid and fair that we make no apology
for copying the whole article embodying the same.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;There is, however, one aspect of the general problem
of political advance which is so important as to require
notice in some detail. We have observed already that
one of the greatest obstacles to India&rsquo;s political development
lies not only in the lack of education among its
peoples taken as a whole, but also in the uneven
distribution of educational advance. The educational
policy of Government has incurred much criticism
from different points of view. Government is charged
with neglect, because after sixty years of educational
effort only 6 per cent. of the population is literate,
while under 4 per cent. of the total population is
undergoing instruction. It is charged, on the other
hand, with having given to those classes which welcomed
instruction a system which is divorced from their
needs in being purely literary, in admitting methods of
unintelligent memorising and of cramming, and in
producing, far in excess of the actual demands of
Indian conditions, a body of educated young men
whose training has prepared them only for Government
service or the practice of law. The system of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
university education on Western lines is represented
as cutting off the students from the normal life of the
country, and the want of connection between primary
education in the vernaculars and higher education
in English is regarded as another radical defect.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>The period of sixty years mentioned is evidently
counted from 1858, the year in which the rule of the
East India Company ceased and the Crown assumed
direct responsibility for the Government of India.
British rule in India however began in 1757 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> and
the foundation of public education in India under
the British might well be considered to have been laid
by Warren Hastings in 1781, in which year the Calcutta
Madrassa was established. For a period of
almost 50 years the discussion whether the Indians
should be instructed in English or not went on until
it was settled in 1835 by Lord Macaulay&rsquo;s famous
minute in favour of English and the European system.
In 1824 there were 14 public institutions in Bengal
imparting education on Western lines.</p>

<p>In the same year, i.e., in 1824, Monstuart Elphinstone
formulated a similar policy for the Bombay
presidency.</p>

<p>To the remarks made in the above quotation about
the extent and kind of education imparted in India
till now, the distinguished authors of the report add:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;From the economic point of view India had been
handicapped by the want of professional and technical
instruction: her colleges turn out numbers of young
men qualified for Government clerkships while the real
interests of the country require, for example, doctors
and engineers in excess of the existing supply. The
charge that Government has produced a large <i>intelligentsia</i>
which cannot find employment has much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
substance in it: it is one of the facts that lie at the
root of recent political difficulties. But it is only of
late years and as part of the remarkable awakening
of national self-consciousness, that the complaint has
been heard that the system has failed to train Indians
for practical work in manufactures, commerce, and
the application of science to industrial life.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>After making a few general observations on the
so called difficulties in the way of a general spread of
education &ldquo;the chief needs at present&rdquo; are thus
pointed out:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Primary education, as we have seen, is already
practically in the hands of local bodies, but secondary
education was deliberately left at the outset almost
entirely to private agencies. The universities, despite
their connection with Government, are largely non-official
bodies with extensive powers.<a name="FNanchor_1_32" id="FNanchor_1_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_32" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The main
defect of the system is probably the want of co-ordination
between primary and higher education, which in
turn reacts upon the efficiency of the secondary institutions
and to a great extent confines university colleges
to the unsatisfactory function of mere finishing schools.
The universities have suffered from having been
allowed to drift into the position of institutions that
are expected not so much to educate in the true sense
as to provide the student with the means of entering
an official or a professional career. Thus a high
percentage of failures seems to a large body of Indian
opinion not so much a proof of the faultiness of the
methods of teaching as an example of an almost capricious
refusal of the means of obtaining a living wage to
boys who have worked for years often at the cost
of real hardship to secure an independent livelihood.
The educational wastage is everywhere excessive;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
and analysis shows that it is largely due to under-payment
and want of proper training in the case of
teachers. The actual recruits for normal schools are
too often ill-prepared, and the teaching career, which
in India used formerly to command respect, does not
now offer adequate inducements to men of ability and
force of character. The first need, therefore, is the
improvement of teaching. Until that is attained it is
vain to expect that the continuation of studies from
the primary stage can be made attractive. But while
the improvement of primary and middle schools is the
first step to be taken, very much remains to be done
in reorganising the secondary teachers and ensuring
for the schoolmaster a career that will satisfy an
intelligent man. The improvement of ordinary secondary
education is obviously a necessary condition for
the development of technical instruction and the
reform of the university system. It is clear that
there is much scope for an efficient and highly trained
inspectorate in stimulating the work of the secondary
schools and in helping the inspectorate of the primary
schools maintained by the local bodies. We believe
that the best minds in India, while they feel that the
educational service has not in the past been widely
enough opened to Indians trained at British universities,
value the maintenance of a close connection with
educationists from the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This survey of educational problems will show how
much room there is for advance and improvement,
and also how real the difficulties are. The defects of
the present system have often been discussed in the
legislative councils, but, as was inevitable so long as
the councils had no responsibility, without due appreciation
of financial difficulties, or serious consideration
of the question how far fresh taxation for educational
improvement would be acceptable. As we shall show,
it is part of the political advance that we contemplate
that the direction of Indian education should be
increasingly transferred to Indian hands. Only so,
we believe, can the stimulus be forthcoming which will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
enable the necessary money to be found. The weak
points are recognised. A real desire for improvement
exists. Educational extension and reform must inevitably
play an important part in the political progress
of the country. We have already made clear our
conviction that political capacity can come only
through the exercise of political responsibility; and
that mere education without opportunities must
result in serious mischief. But there is another
important element. Progress must depend on the
growth of electorates and the intelligent exercise of
their powers; and men will be immensely helped to
become competent electors by acquiring such education
as will enable them to judge candidates for their votes,
and of the business done in the councils. No one
would propose to prescribe an educational qualification
for the vote; but no one can deny the practical difficulties
which make a very general extension of the
franchise impossible, until literacy is far more widely
spread than is the case at present. Progress was
temporarily interrupted by uncertainty as to the
distribution of financial resources which would result
from the constitutional changes; but the imminence
of these has given a new importance to the question
and its consideration has been resumed. We trust
that impetus will thus be given to a widespread movement
which will be taken up and carried forward boldly
by the reformed councils.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>The subject has been so fairly dealt with, the defects
of the present system so frankly recognised and the
need of wider dissemination of education so forcibly
explained that we need add nothing.</p>

<p>In our judgment the circumstances and conditions
under which it is proposed to transfer the direction of
Indian education to Indian hands are extremely
unfair. It is admitted that under the present economic
conditions of the Indian people, there is little scope<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
for further taxation. If so, there are only two ways
to find money for education, (<i>a</i>) by economy in the
other departments of public administration, (<i>b</i>) by
loans.</p>

<p>The recommendation made by the Secretary of
State and the Viceroy for an increase in the emoluments
of the European services hardly leaves any
room for (<i>a</i>). We have discussed the matter at some
length in another chapter. The only other source
left, then, is by incurring debt. Education is so
important and so fundamental to the future progress
of the country that in our judgment the ministers
should feel no hesitation in having recourse to it, but
the problem is so gigantic that, lacking material
reduction in the cost of administration in other departments,
it will be extremely difficult to meet the situation
without an unreasonable increase in the public debt.
Anyway, under the scheme recommended, the Government
cannot divest itself of the fullest responsibility
in the matter. The scheme gives no vital power to the
electorates or their representatives. The authority of
the Executive in the matter of appropriations remains
unaffected and so long as it retains the final say in
the making of the Budget, the Indian ministers cannot,
handicapped by so many restrictions, be held responsible
if the progress is slow.</p>

<p>Our views on the problem of education in India
have been expressed in a separate book to which
interested readers are referred.<a name="FNanchor_2_33" id="FNanchor_2_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_33" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> We hold that it is
the duty of the Government to provide free and
wholesome education to every child at public cost,
that education should be compulsory up to the age
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>of 18. The policy of the English Education Act of
1918 ought to be applied to India, and if it cannot be
done from current funds, loans should be raised for the
purpose. It is a matter which brooks of no delay.
The whole future of India depends upon it. Nay,
the future of humanity as a whole is affected by it.
The world cannot be safe for any kind of democracy,
nor can the world make progress towards a better
order without the active co&ouml;peration of three hundred
and fifteen million Indians forming one-fifth of the
human race. Not only is the world poorer by reason
of India&rsquo;s inability to co&ouml;perate in the work of progress
but its present educational backwardness is a
serious handicap to the rest of humanity going
forward.</p>

THE PROBLEM</h2>


<p>We have so far discussed the Report and such remarks
as we have made have been by way of comment.
In this chapter we propose to give in brief outline our
own view of the problem.</p>

<p>Let us first be clear about the exact nature of the
Indian problem. Political institutions are, after all,
only a reflection of the national mind and of national
conditions. What is the end? The end is freedom
to live and to live according to our own conception of
what life should be, to pursue our own ideals, to
develop our own civilization and to secure that unity
of purpose which would distinguish us from the other
nations of the world, insuring for us a position of
independence and honor, of security from within and
non-interference from without. We have no ambition
to conquer and rule other peoples; we have no desire
to exploit foreign markets; not even to impose our
&ldquo;kultur&rdquo; and our &ldquo;civilization&rdquo; on others. At present
we are counted among the backward peoples of the
earth mainly because we are a subject people, governed
by a foreign power, protected by foreign bayonets
and schooled by foreign teachers. The condition of
our masses is intellectually deplorable and economically
miserable; our women are still in bondage and do not
enjoy that freedom which their Western sisters have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
won; our domestic masters, the prince and priest, are
still in saddle; caste and privilege still hold some sway,
yet it is not true that, taken all in all, we are really a
backward people. Even in these matters we find
that the difference between us and the &ldquo;advanced&rdquo;
nations of the world is one of degree only. Caste and
privilege rule in the United States as much as in India.
There is nothing in our history which can be put on the
same level as the lynching of Mr. Little, the deportation
of Bisbee miners, the lynching of the Negroes, and
other incidents of a similar nature indicative of race
hatred and deep rooted colour prejudice. No nation
in the world can claim an <i>ideal state of society</i>, in which
everything is of the best. On the other hand, there
are certain matters in which comparison is to our
advantage. Even with the advance of drunkenness
under British rule we are yet a sober nation; our
<i>standards</i> of personal and domestic hygiene are much
higher than those of the Western people; our standards
of life much simpler and nobler; our social ideals
more humane; and our spiritual aspirations infinitely
superior. As a nation we do not believe in war or
militarism or evangelism. We do not force our views
on others; we have greater toleration for other people&rsquo;s
opinions and beliefs than has any other nation in the
world; we have not yet acquired that craze for possessions
and for sheer luxurious and riotous life which
marks the modern Pharisee of the West. Our people,
according to their conceptions, means and opportunities
are kindly, hospitable, gentle, law-abiding,
mutually helpful, full of respect for others, and peace
loving. It is, in fact, the abnormal extent in which
these qualities exist that has contributed to our political<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
and economic exploitation by others. In India
capitalism and landlordism have not yet developed as
fully as they have among the civilized nations of the
West. The West is in revolt against capitalism and
landlordism. We do not claim that before the advent
of the British there was no capitalism or landlordism
in India. But we do contend that, though there was
a certain amount of rivalry and competition between
the different castes, within the castes there was much
more co&ouml;peration and fellow-feeling than there has
ever been in the West. Our native governments and
their underlings, the landlords, did exact a high price
from the village communities for the privilege of
cultivating their lands but within the village there
was no <i>inter se</i> competition either between the tillers
of the soil or between the pursuers of crafts. The
gulf between the rich and the poor was not so marked
as it is to-day in the West.</p>

<p>Under the British rule and since its introduction,
however, things have changed considerably. Without
adopting the best features of modern life, we have been
forced by circumstances, political and economic, to
give up the best of our own. Village communities
have been destroyed; joint and corporate bargaining
has given place to individual transactions; every bit
of land has been separately measured, marked and
taxed; common lands have been divided; the price of
land and rent has risen abnormally. The money-lender
who, before the advent of British rule, held
an extremely subordinate position in the village
community, has suddenly come to occupy the first
place. He owns the best lands and the best houses
and holds the bodies and souls of the agricultur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>alists
in mortgage. The villages which were generally
homogeneous in population, bound to each
other by ties of race, blood and religion, have become
heterogeneous, with nondescript people of all races
and all religions who have acquired land by purchase.
Competition has taken the place of co&ouml;peration.
A country where social co&ouml;peration and
social solidarity reigned at least within castes, within
villages and within urban areas has been entirely
disrupted and disintegrated by unlimited and uncontrolled
competition. India never knew any poor
laws; she never needed any; nor orphan asylums,
nor old age pensions and widow homes. She had no
use for organized charity. Rarely did any man die
for want of food or clothing, except in famines. Hospitality
was open and was dispensed under a sense of
duty and obligation and not by way of charity or
kindness. The survival of the fittest had no hold on
our minds. We had no factories or workshops. People
worked in their <i>own</i> homes or shops either with their
own money or with money borrowed from the money-lender.
The artisans were the masters of the goods
they produced and, unless otherwise agreed with the
money-lender, sold them in the open market. The
necessities of life, being cheap and easily procurable
the artisans cared more for quality than quantity.
Their work was a source of pleasure and pride as well
as of profit to them. Now everything has gone,
pleasure, pride, as well as profit. Where profit has
remained, pleasure and pride are gone. We are on
the high road to a &ldquo;distinctly industrial civilization.&rdquo;
In fact, the principal complaint of our political reformers
and free trade economists is that the British<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
Government has not let us proceed on that road at a
sufficiently rapid pace and that, in preventing us,
they have been dominated by their own national
interests more than by our own good. We saw that
other nations were progressing by following the laws
of industrial development, and quite naturally we also
wanted to prosper by the same method. This war
has opened our eyes as it has opened those of the rest
of the world and we have begun to feel that the goal
that we sought leads to perdition and not salvation.
This makes it necessary for the Indian politicians and
economists to review their ideas of political progress.
What are we aiming at? Do we want to rise, in order
to fall? Do we want to copy and emulate Europe
even in its mistakes and blunders? Does the road to
heaven lie through hell? Must we make a wreck of
our ship and then try salvage? The civilization of
Europe, as we have known it, is dying. It may take
decades or perhaps a century or more to die. But
<i>die it must</i>. This War has prepared a death bed for
it from which it will never rise. Upon its ruins is
rising, or will rise, another civilization which will
reproduce much of what was valuable and precious in
our own with much of what we never had. The
question that we want to put to our compatriots is,
shall we prepare ourselves for the coming era, or shall
we bury ourselves in the d&eacute;bris of the expiring one.
We have no right to answer it for others, but our
answer is clear and unequivocal. We will not be a
party to any scheme which shall add to the powers of
the capitalist and the landlord and will introduce and
accentuate the evils of the expiring industrial civilization
into our beloved country.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>We are not unaware that, according to the judgment
of some thinkers, amongst them Karl Marx, a country
must pass through the capitalistic mill, before the
proletariat comes to its own. We do not believe in
the truth of this theory, but even if it be true we will
not consciously help in proving it to be true. The
existing social order of Europe is vicious and immoral.
It is worm eaten. It has the germs of plague, disease,
death and destitution in it. It is in a state of decomposition.
It is based on injustice, tyranny, oppression
and class rule. Certain phases of it are inherent in
our own system. Certain others we are borrowing
from our masters in order to make a complete mess.
Wisdom and foresight require that we be forewarned.
What we want and what we need is not the power to
implant in full force and in full vigour the <i>expiring</i>
European system, but power to keep out its development
on vicious lines, with opportunities of gradually
and slowly undoing the evil that has already been
done.</p>

<p>The Government of India as at present constituted
is a Government of capitalists and landlords, of both
England and India. Under the proposed scheme the
power of the former will be reduced and that of the
latter increased. The Indo-British Association does
not like it, not because it loves the masses of India
for which it hypocritically and insincerely professes
solicitude, but because in their judgment it reduces
the profits of the British governing classes. We doubt
if the scheme really does affect even that. But if it
does, it is good so far.</p>

<p>The ugly feature of the scheme is not its potentiality
in transferring the power into the hands of the Brah<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>mins
(the power of the Brahmin as such, is gone for
good), but in the possibility of its giving too much
power to the &ldquo;profiteering&rdquo; class, be they the landlords
of Bengal and Oudh, or the millionaires of Bombay.
The scheme protects the European merchants; it
confers special privileges on the small European Community;
it provides special representation for the
landlords, the Chambers of Commerce, the Mohammedans
and the Sikhs. What is left for the general
tax-paying public is precious little. The authors of
the scheme say that to withhold complete and immediate
Home Rule is in the interest of the general
masses, the poor inarticulate ryot and the workingman.
We wish we could believe in it. We wish it were true.
Perhaps they mean it, but our past experience does
not justify our accepting it at its face value.</p>

<p>There is, however, one thing we can do. We can
ask them for proofs by insisting on and agitating for
the immediate legislative relief of the ryot and the
middle classes. We should adopt the aims of the
British Labour Party as our own, start educating our
people on those lines and formulate measures which
will secure for them <i>real freedom</i> and not the counterfeit
coin which passes for it. It will require years of
education and agitation but it has to be done, no
matter whether we are ruled by the British or by our
own property holders. We are not opposed to Home
Rule. Nay, we press for it. In our judgment the
objections urged against giving it at once are flimsy
and intangible. The chief obstacles are such as have
been created or perpetuated by the British themselves.
The caste does not prevent us from having <i>at least</i>
as much home rule as is enjoyed by the people of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
Italy, Hungary, the Balkan States and some of the
South American Republics. But if we cannot have
it at once and if the British must retain the power
of final decision in their hands, we must insist upon
something being immediately done not only to educate
the ryot but to give him economic relief. So long as
the British continue to refuse to do that we must
hold them responsible for all the misery that Indian
humanity is suffering from.</p>

<p>We want political power in order to raise the intellectual
and political status of our masses. We do
not want to bolster up classes. Our goal is real liberty,
equality and opportunity for all. We want to avoid,
if possible, the evils of the class struggle. We will
pass through the mill if we must, but we should like to
try to avoid it. For that reason we want freedom to
legislate and freedom to determine our fiscal arrangements.
That is our main purpose in our demand
for Home Rule.</p>

THE INTERNATIONAL ASPECT</h2>


<p>Thus far we have discussed the Indian question
from the internal or national point of view. But it
has an international aspect also. It is said, and we
hope that it is true, that the world is entering into an
era of new internationalism and that the old exclusive
chauvinistic nationalism is in its last gasps. This
war was the greatest social mix-up known to history.
It has brought about the downfall of many monarchs
and the destruction of four empires. The armies of
the belligerents on both sides contained the greatest
assortment of races and nations, of religions and
languages that were ever brought together for mutual
destruction. Primarily a fight between the European
Christians, it drew into its arena Hindus, Mohammedans,
Buddhists, Shintos, Jews and Negroes of Africa
and America.</p>

<p>The war has produced a revolution in Russia, the
like of which has never been known. It is now said
openly that the Russian Revolution had as much
influence on the final <i>debacle</i> of the Central Powers as
the strength of the Allies and the resources of America.
The revolution has spread to Germany and Austria
and threatens to engulf the whole of Europe. It has
given birth to a new order of society, aglow with the
spirit of a new and elevated kind of internationalism.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
This internationalism must have for its foundation
justice and self-determination for all peoples, regardless
of race or religion, creed or color. In the new understanding
between nations co&ouml;peration must be substituted
for competition and mutual trust and helpfulness
for distrust and exploitation of the weaker by the
stronger. The only alternatives are reaction, with the
certainty of even greater war in the near future, and
Bolshevism.</p>

<p>Now, nobody knows what Bolshevism represents.
The Socialists themselves are divided over it. The
advanced wing is enthusiastic, the moderates are
denouncing it. The Liberals and Radicals are freely
recognizing that it has brought into the affairs of men
a new spirit which is going to stay and substantially
influence the future of the world. The stand-patters
denounce it in the strongest possible terms. They
calumniate it to their heart&rsquo;s content and move heaven
and earth to exterminate it. But we feel that only
radical changes in the existing order will stem its tide.
The Socialists and Radicals want to make the most
of it, while the Imperialist Liberals and Conservatives
want to give as little as is compatible with the safety
of the existing order in which they are supreme. The
struggle will take some time, but that it will end in
favor of the new spirit no one doubts.</p>

<p>The only way to meet Bolshevism is to concede
rights to the different peoples of the earth now
being bled and exploited. Otherwise the discontented
and exploited countries of the world will be the best
breeding centres for it. India must come into her
own soon, else not even the Himalayas can effectually
bar the entry of Bolshevism into India. A contented,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
self-governing India may be proof against it; a discontented,
dissatisfied, oppressed India perhaps the most
fertile field. We hope the British statesmen are alive
to the situation.</p>

<p>But that is not the only way to look at the international
importance of India. By its geographical
situation it is the connecting link between the Near
East and the Far East and the clearing house for the
trade of the world. Racially, it holds the balance
between the European Aryan and the yellow races.
In any military conflict between the white and the
yellow races, the people of India will be a decisive
factor. In a conflict of peace they will be a harmonising
element. Racially they are the kin of the European.
By religion and culture they are nearer the Chinese
and Japanese.</p>

<p>With 70 million Moslems India is the most important
centre of Mohammedan sentiment. With Christians
as their present rulers, the Hindus and Mohammedans
of India are coming to realise that their best interests
require a closing up of their ranks. There is no doubt
that, come what may, their relations in future will be
much more cordial, friendly and mutually sympathetic
than they have been in the past. The Hindus will
stand by their Mohammedan countrymen in all their
efforts to revive the glory of Islam, and to regain
political independence for it. There is no fear of a
Pan-Islamic movement if the new spirit of internationalism
prevails. If, however, it does not, the
Pan-Islamic movement might find a sympathetic
soul in India. Islam is not dead. It cannot and will
not die. The only way to make it a force for harmony
and peace is to recognise its potentialities and to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
respect its susceptibilities. The political independence
of Islamic countries is the basic foundation for such
a state. We hope that the statesmen of the world
will give their most earnest thought to the question
and sincerely put into practice the principles they
have been enunciating during the war. The case of
India will be an acid test.</p>

<p>A happy India will make a valuable contribution to
the evolution of a better and more improved humanity.
An unhappy India will clog the wheels of progress.
It will not be easy for the masters of India to rule it
on old lines. If not reconciled it might prove the
pivot of the next war. A happy India will be one of
the brightest spots in the British Commonwealth.
A discontented India will be a cause of standing shame
and a source of never ending trouble.</p>

<p>With a republican China in the northeast, a constitutional
Persia in the northwest and a Bolshevist
Russia in the not remote north, it will be extremely
foolish to attempt to rule India despotically. Not
even the gods can do it. It is not possible even if the
legislature devotes all its sittings to the drafting and
passing of one hundred coercion acts. The peace of
the world, international harmony and good-will, the
good name of the British Commonwealth, the safety
of the Empire as such, demand the peaceful introduction
and development of democracy in India.</p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX_A" id="APPENDIX_A"></a>APPENDIX A<br />

A SYNOPSIS OF THE INDIAN INDUSTRIAL
COMMISSIONERS&rsquo; REPORT</h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>A bureaucracy has the fatal tendency of perpetuating
itself and of making itself indispensable. As a result,
we find that the prospects and powers of the bureaucracy
become more important than even the
purposes for which it exists. It is a commonplace of
politics that a state exists for the people comprising
it, and that the servants of the state are the servants
of the people. They are the tools which the body
politic uses for its corporate life. Even in self-governed
countries the tendency of glorifying the state and the
servants of the state at the cost of the people is not
uncommon, though the fact is not, or rarely, if at
all, admitted in so many words. In dependencies
and countries governed by a foreign bureaucracy,
however, this fact is undisguisedly kept before the
people and they are openly and frankly told that the
powers and prospects of the servants of the government
are of greater consequence and importance than
the wishes and welfare of the people. This is amply
illustrated by the extravagant scale on which the
government of India pays its European servants and
goes on adding to their privileges under all sorts of
pretences and excuses. People may live or they
may die for want of food, for lack of knowledge of the
ordinary laws of hygiene, for lack of employment,
but the bureaucrats must enjoy their princely salaries,
their hill allowances, their furlough, and travelling
and leave perquisites, promotions and pensions.
If the cost of living increases, they must get a raise
in their salaries, no matter how the increased cost of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
living affects the general body of the people. Besides,
they must have their pensions, as their children are
infinitely more important than those of the tax-payer.</p>

<p>We have already reproduced and discussed the
recommendations of the Secretary of State for India
and the Viceroy, about the European members of the
Indian services. The Viceroy has only recently
emphasized the importance of a substantial increase
in their salaries, although there is a deficit of 20 million
dollars in the budget estimates for the next year.
That is an old story, however. What we are immediately
concerned with are the recommendations of
the Indian Industrial Commission, in favor of creating
a new branch of public service divided into the inevitable
Imperial and Provincial branches, for furthering
the industrial development of the country. Our
meaning will be clear as we proceed.</p>

<p>The Indian Industrial Commission was appointed
by the Government of India &ldquo;to examine and report
upon the possibilities of further industrial development
in India and to submit its recommendations
with special references to the following questions:&mdash;</p>

<p class="negidt">(<i>a</i>) whether new openings for the profitable
employment of Indian capital in commerce
can be indicated.</p>

<p class="negidt">(<i>b</i>) whether, and if so, in what manner, government
can usefully give direct encouragement
to industrial development,</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="negidt">1. by rendering technical advice more
freely available;</p>

<p class="negidt">2. by the demonstration of the possibility,
on a commercial scale, of particular
industries;</p>

<p class="negidt">3. by affording, directly, or indirectly,
financial assistance to industrial enterprise;
or</p>

<p class="negidt">4. by any other means which are not incompatible
with the existing fiscal policy of
the government of India.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>The tariff question was excluded from the scope of
the Commission&rsquo;s inquiries, though it was expressed
that the &ldquo;building up of industries where the capital,
control and management should be in the hands of
the Indians&rdquo; was the &ldquo;special object&rdquo; which the
government had in view. The Government spokesman
in the meeting of the Legislative Council at which the
appointment of the Commission was announced
further emphasized &ldquo;that it was of immense importance,
alike to India herself and to the Empire as a
whole, that Indians should take a larger share in the
industrial development of their country.&rdquo; He &ldquo;deprecated
the taking of any steps, if it might merely
mean that the manufacturer who now competes with
you from a distance would transfer his activities to
India and compete with you within your boundaries.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Commission has now submitted its report
which has been published as a Parliamentary blue
book in a bulky volume of about 500 pages including
a separate lengthy note by one of the leading Indian
members of the Commission. The note is, in our
judgment, very valuable, as it gives the Indian point
of view of the industrial problem in such a lucid and
exhaustive way as to leave no room for doubt as to
what articulate India thinks in the matter. The
note does not express only the personal opinion of
the author but the considered views of the Indian
Nationalist Party.</p>

<p>Both the report and the note have been the source
of much personal gratification to us as they corroborate
and confirm to an extraordinary extent what the author
said in his book &ldquo;England&rsquo;s Debt to India,&rdquo; though
the report is by no means free from fallacies and one-sided
statements of fact and opinions.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>In the words of the summary prefixed to the report:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first chapters of the report deal with India
as an industrial country, her present position, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
her potentialities. They show how little the march
of modern industry has affected the great bulk of the
Indian population, which remains engrossed in agriculture,
winning a bare subsistence from the soil by
antiquated methods of cultivation. Such changes
as have been wrought in rural areas are the effects of
economic rather than of industrial evolution. In
certain centers the progress of Western industrial
methods is discernible; and a number of these are
described in order to present a picture of the conditions
under which industries are carried on, attention
being drawn to the shortage and to the general inefficiency
of Indian labor and to the lack of an indigenous
supervising agency. Proposals are made
for the better exploitation of the forests and fisheries.
In discussing the industrial deficiencies of India, the
report shows how unequal the industrial development
of our industries has been. Money has been invested
in commerce rather than industries, and only those
industries have been taken up which appeared to offer
safe and easy profits. Previous to the war, too ready
reliance was placed on imports from overseas, and this
habit was fostered by the Government practice of
purchasing stores in England. India produces nearly
all the raw materials necessary for the requirements of
a modern community; but is unable to manufacture
many of the articles and materials necessary alike
in times of peace and war. For instance, her great
textile industries are dependent upon supplies of
imported machinery and would have to shut down if
command of the seas were lost. It is vital, therefore,
for the Government to ensure the establishment of
those industries in India whose absence exposes us to
grave danger in event of war. The report advocates
the introduction of modern methods of agriculture and
in particular of labor-saving devices. Greater efficiency
in cultivation, and in the preparation of produce
for the market would follow; labor now wastefully
employed would be set free for industries and the
establishment of shops for the manufacture and repair<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
of machinery would lead to the growth of a huge
engineering industry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The summarized statements will be made more
clear by the following extracts from Chapter I on rural
India.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Famine connotes not so much a scarcity or entire
absence of food as high prices and a lack of employment
in the affected areas.... The capital in the
hands of the country traders has proved insufficient
to finance the ordinary movements of crops and the
seasonal calls for accommodations from the main
financial centers are constantly increasing. This lack
of available capital is one cause of the high rates that
the ryot has to pay for the ready money which he needs
to buy seed and to meet the expenses of cultivation.
On the other hand, money is largely invested in the
purchase of landed property, the price of which has
risen to very high figures in many parts of the country....
But the no less urgent necessity of relieving the
ryot from the enormous load of debt with which he
has been burdened by the dearness of agricultural
capital, the necessity of meeting periodic demands for
rent and his social habits, has hitherto been met only
to a very small extent by co-operative organization.
The farmer, owing partly to poverty and partly
to the extreme sub-division of the land, is very often
a producer on so small a scale that it is practically
impossible for him to take his crops to the larger
markets where he can sell at current rates to the
agents of the bigger firms.... A better market
system, co-operative selling, and education are the
promising remedies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Coming to the industrial centers of the country
apart from the rural areas, the report says:</p>

<p>&ldquo;A characteristic feature of organised industry
and commerce in all the chief Indian centers is the
presence of large agency firms which, except in the
case of Bombay, are mainly European. In addition
to participating in the export and import trade, they
finance and manage industrial ventures all over the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
country, and often have several branches in the large
towns. The importance of these agency houses may
be gauged by the fact that they are in control of the
majority of the cotton, jute and other mills as well as
of the tea gardens and the coal mines.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The general remarks about the industrial deficiency
of the country will be better understood from the
following extracts:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have already referred to the dependence of
India on outside sources of sulphur and the necessity
for insisting on the local smelting of her sulphide ores.
In the absence of any means for producing from purely
Indian sources sulphuric, nitric, and hydrochloric
acids, and alkalis, our manufactures, actual or prospective,
of paper, drugs, matches, oils, explosives,
disinfectants, dyes and textiles are dependent upon
imports which under war conditions, might be cut
off. Sources of raw materials for heavy chemicals are
deficient. The output of saltpeter could be raised to
40,000 tons per annum and supplementary supplies
of nitrates could be produced, if necessary, from atmospheric
nitrogen; but for this again, cheap electric
power is needed. Salt occurs in abundance and the
establishment of caustic soda manufacture, preferably
by an electric process, that would also yield chlorine,
is a necessary part of our chemical programme. There
are available in the country, in fair quantity, many
other raw materials necessary for heavy chemical
manufacture, in addition to those referred to under
other heads; among them may be mentioned alum,
salts, barytes, borax, gypsum, limestone, magnesia,
phosphates of lime and ochres. The installation of
plants for the recovery of by-products in coking has
recently been undertaken, but for the recovery of
tar and ammonia only. The recovery of benzol and
related products has so far not been attempted nor has
anything been done to utilise the tar by re-distillation
or other chemical treatment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Although India exported raw rubber valued in 1917-1918
at 162 lakhs, rubber manufacture has not been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
started in the country and goods to the value of 116
lakhs were imported in 1917-1918. This industry is
one of those that are essential in the national interest
and should be inaugurated, if necessary, by special
measures.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Though textile industries exist on a large scale,
the range of goods produced is still narrow, and we are
dependent upon foreign sources for nearly all of our
miscellaneous textile requirements. In addition to
these, the ordinary demands of Indian consumers
necessitate the import of some Rs. 66 crores worth
of cotton piece-goods, and interference with this
source of supply has caused serious hardship. Flax
is not yet grown in appreciable quantities and the
indigenous species of so-called hemp, though abundantly
grown, are not at present used in any organized
Indian industry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our ability to produce and to preserve many of
our foodstuffs in transportable forms or to provide
receptacles for mineral or vegetable oils depends upon
the supply of tin plates which India at present imports
in the absence of local manufactures.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our few paper factories before the war stood on an
uncertain basis and we are still dependent upon foreign
manufacture for most of the higher qualities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>India produces enormous quantities of leather on
a relatively small scale by modern processes; and the
village tanner supplies the local needs only, and with
a very inferior material. To obtain the quantities
and standards of finished leather which the country
requires, it will be necessary to stimulate industries
by the institution of technical training and by the
experimental work on a considerable scale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Large quantities of vegetable products are exported
for the manufacture of drugs, dyes and essential oils,
which in many cases are re-imported into India.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The blanks in our industrial catalog are of a kind
most surprising to one familiar only with the European
conditions. We have already alluded generally to
the basic deficiencies in our iron and steel industries<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
and have explained how, as a result, the many engineering
shops in India are mainly devoted to the repair
or to the manufacture of, hitherto mainly from imported
materials, comparatively simple structures,
such as roofs, bridges, wagons and tanks. India can
build a small marine engine and turn out a locomotive
provided certain essential parts are obtained from
abroad but <i>she has not a machine to make nails or
screws, nor can she manufacture some of the essential
parts of electrical machinery</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1_34" id="FNanchor_1_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_34" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;Electrical plant and equipment are still, therefore,
imported, in spite of the fact that incandescent lamps
are used by the millions and electric fans by the tens
of thousands. India relies on foreign supplies of
steel springs and iron chains and for wire ropes, a
vital necessity of her mining industry. We have
already pointed out the absence of any manufacture
of textile mill accessories. The same may be said
of the equipment of nearly all industrial concerns.
The list of deficiencies includes all kinds of machine
tools, steam engines, boilers and gas and oil engines,
hydraulic presses and heavy cranes. Simple lathes,
small sugar mills, small pumps, and a variety of odds
and ends are made in some shops, but the basis of
their manufacture and the limited scale of production
do not enable them to compete with imported goods
of similar character to the extent of excluding the
latter. Agriculturists&rsquo; and planters&rsquo; tools such as
ploughs, <i>mamooties</i>, spades, shovels and pickaxes are
mainly imported as well as the hand tools of improved
character used in most cottage industries, including
wood-working tools, healds and reeds, shuttles and
pickers. Bicycles, motor cycles and motor cars cannot
at present be made in India though the imports under
these heads were valued at Rs. 187 lakhs in 1913-1914.
The manufacture of common glass is carried
on in various localities, and some works have turned
out ordinary domestic utensils and bottles of fair
quality, but no attempt has been made to produce<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
plate or sheet glass or indeed any of the harder kinds
of commercial glass, while optical glass manufacture
has never even been mooted. The extent of our dependence
on imported glass is evidenced by the fact
that in 1913-1914 this was valued at Rs. 164 lakhs.
Porcelain insulators, good enough for low tension
currents, are manufactured, but India does not produce
the higher qualities of either porcelain or
china....</p>

<p>&ldquo;The list of industries which, though their products
are essential alike in peace and war, are lacking in this
country, <i>is lengthy and almost ominous</i>.<a name="FNanchor_2_35" id="FNanchor_2_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_35" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Until they are
brought into existence on an adequate scale, Indian
capitalists will, in times of peace, be deprived of a
number of profitable enterprises; whilst in the event
of war which renders the sea transport impossible,
India&rsquo;s all-important existing industries will be exposed
to the risk of stoppage, her consumers to great hardship,
and her armed forces to the gravest danger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In discussing the part played by Indians of all
classes in the industrial development of the Country
the Commission observes:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is obvious that the great obstacles are the lack
of even vernacular education and the low standard of
comfort. The higher grade of worker, the mechanical
artisan, in the absence of adequate education has
been prevented from attaining a greater degree of
skill. He finds himself where he is, less by deliberate
choice than by the accident of his obtaining work at
some railway or other engineering shop, or by the
possession of a somewhat more enterprising spirit
than his fellows. There is at present only very inadequate
provision for any form of technical training
to supplement the experience that he can gain by actual
work in an engineering shop, while the generally
admitted need for a more trustworthy and skillful
type of man is at present met by importing charge-men
and foremen from abroad.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>
<p>In short, the industrial deficiencies of India are
directly due to</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="negidt">(<i>a</i>) lack of education, general, scientific, and
technical.</p>

<p class="negidt">(<i>b</i>) lack of encouragement by the Government
which has so far deliberately purchased most
kinds of stores needed for government requirements
from England.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The agricultural deficiencies are due to the same
causes plus the poverty of the ryot and his inability
to secure the capital necessary for improvements on
reasonable terms of interest. Yet, in spite of this we
find the Commission laying unwarranted emphasis
upon the creation of new posts divided into Imperial
and Provincial branches for Industrial, Agricultural,
and scientific experts. One should have thought
that the first recommendation should be the immediate
inauguration of general education throughout the
country with adequate provision for technical, scientific,
agricultural and commercial instruction.</p>

<p>The industrial development of the country needs
these things: (1) general education, (2) cheap capital,
(3) skilled labor, (4) protection against improper
foreign competition. Expert advice and research are
needed very much, but no amount of research or expert
advice will advance the cause of industries unless the
level of general intelligence has been raised and some
provision made for cheap capital and skilled labor.
Says the Honorable Malaviya in his separate note:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the industries of India are to develop, and
Indians to have a fair chance in the competition to
which they are exposed, it is essential that a system
of education at least as good as that of Japan should
be introduced in India. I am at one with my colleagues
in urging the fundamental necessity of providing
primary education for the artisan and laboring
population. No system of industrial and technical
education can be reared except on that basis. But
the artisan and laboring population do not stand apart<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
from the rest of the community; and therefore if
this <i>sine qua non</i> of industrial efficiency and economic
progress is to be established it is necessary that primary
education should be made universal. I agree
also in urging that drawing and manual training should
be introduced into primary schools as soon as possible.
In my opinion, until primary education is made universal,
if not compulsory, and until drawing is made
a compulsory subject in all primary schools, the
foundation of a satisfactory system of industrial and
technical education will be wanting. Of course
this will require time. But I think that that is exactly
why an earnest endeavor should be made in this
direction without any further avoidable delay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In support of his opinion he quotes the following
pertinent observation of Mr. Samuelson:</p>

<p>&ldquo;In conclusion, I have to state my deep conviction
that the people of India expect and demand of their
government the design, organization and execution of
systematic technical education and there is urgent
need for it to bestir itself, for other nations have already
sixty years&rsquo; start of us, and have produced several
generations of educated workmen. Even if we begin
to-morrow the technical education of all the youths
of twelve years of age, who have received sound elementary
education, it will take seven years before these
young men can commence the practical business of
life and then they will form but an insignificant minority
in an uneducated mass. It will take fifteen
years before those children who have not yet begun
to receive an elementary education shall have passed
from the age of 7 to 21 and represent a completely
trained generation; and even then they will find less
than half of their comrades educated. In the race of
nations, therefore, we shall find it hard to overtake the
sixty years that we have lost. To-morrow, then let
us undertake with all our energy our neglected task;
the urgency is twofold&mdash;a small proportion of our
youth has received elementary education, but no
technical education: for that portion let us at once<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
organize technical schools in every small town, technical
colleges in every large town and a technical
university in the metropolis. The rest of the rising
generation has received no education at all, and for
them let us at once organize elementary education,
even if compulsory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To provide for a new department of experts on a
lavish scale before making an adequate provision for
general education is putting the cart before the horse.
This has been pointed out in a very able article by
one of our premier scientists (who has taken a leading
part in the development of Indian industries) published
in the <i>Modern Review</i>, Calcutta, for March,
1919.</p>

<p>Says Sir P. C. Roy:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We always begin at the wrong end. I should be
the last person to disparage the necessity for scientific
research. The simple fact is, however, overlooked
that our agricultural population, steeped in ignorance
and illiteracy and owning only small plots and scattered
holdings, are not in a position to take advantage
of or utilize the elaborate scientific researches which
lie entombed in the bulletins and transactions of these
Institutes. Mr. Mackenna very rightly observes:
The Famine Commissioners, so long ago as 1880,
expressed the view that no general advance in the
agricultural system can be expected until the rural
population had been so educated as to enable them to
take a practical interest in agricultural progress and
reform. These views were confirmed by the Agricultural
Conference of 1888. The most important and
probably the soundest proposition laid down by the
Conference was that it was most desirable to extend
primary education amongst agricultural classes. Such
small countries as Denmark, Holland and Belgium
are in a position to send immense supplies of cheese,
butter, eggs, etc., to England, because the farmers
there are highly advanced in general enlightenment
and technical education and are thus in a position
to profit by the researches of experts. The peasant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
proprietors of France are equally fortunate in this
respect; over and above the abundant harvest of
cereals they grow vine and oranges and have been
highly successful in sericulture; while the silk industry,
in its very cradle, so to speak, namely Murshidabad
and Malda, is languishing and is in a moribund condition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Various forms of cattle plague, e.g., render pest,
foot and mouth disease, make havoc of our cattle every
year and the ignorant masses steeped in superstitions,
look helplessly on and ascribe the visitations to the
wrath of the Goddess Sitala. It is useless to din
Pasteur&rsquo;s researches into their ears. As I have said
before, our Government has the happy knack of beginning
at the wrong end. An ignorant people and
a costly machinery of scientific experts ill go together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The panacea recommended for the cure and treatment
of all these ills is the foundation or re-organization
of costly bureaus and Scientific and Technical services,
the latter with the differentiation of &ldquo;Imperial&rdquo; and
the &lsquo;Provincial&rsquo; Services, which are in reality hotbeds
for the breeding of racial antipathies and sedition.
For the recruitment of the Scientific Services the Commissioners
coolly propose that not only senior and
experienced men should be obtained at as early an age
as possible, preferably not exceeding 25 years. What
lamentable ignorance the Commissioners betray and
what poor conception they have of this vital question
is further evident from what they say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We should thus secure the University graduate,
who had done one or perhaps two years&rsquo; post-graduate
work whether scientific or practical, but would not
yet be confirmed in specialization. We assume that
the requisite degree of specialization will be secured
by adopting a system whereby study leave will be
granted at some suitable time after three years&rsquo; service,
when a scientific officer should have developed the
distinct bent.&rsquo; In other words, secure a dark horse
and wait till he develops a distinct bent! The writer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
of this article naturally feels a little at home on this
subject and it is only necessary to cite a few instances
to illustrate how, under the proposed scheme Indians
will fare. At the present moment there are four
young Indian Doctors of Science of British universities,
three belonging to that of London. Two of them only
have been able to secure Government appointments,
but these only temporary, drawing two-thirds of the
grade pay. One has already given up his post in
disgust because he could get no assurance that the
post would be made permanent. In fact, both of
them have been given distinctly to understand that
as soon as the war conditions are over, permanent
incumbents for these posts will be recruited at &ldquo;home.&rdquo;
In filling up the posts of the so-called experts one very
important factor is overlooked. As a rule, only
third rate men care to come out to India. The choice
lies between the best brains of India and the mediocres
of England and yet the former get but scant consideration
and justice.... The creation of so many
Scientific &ldquo;Imperial&rdquo; services means practically so
many close preserves for Europeans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the chapter dealing with Industrial and Technical
training the Commission observes:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The system of education introduced by the Government
was, at the outset, mainly intended to provide
for the administrative needs of the country and encouraged
literary and philosophic studies to the neglect
of those of more practical character. In the
result it created a disproportionate number of persons
possessing purely literary education, at a time when
there was hardly any form of practical education in
existence. Naturally, the market value of the services
of persons so educated began eventually to diminish.
Throughout the nineteenth century the policy of the
Government was controlled by the doctrine of <i>laissez-faire</i>
in commercial and industrial matters, and its
efforts to develop the resources of the country were
largely limited to the provision of improved methods<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
of transport and the construction of irrigation works.
Except in Bombay, the introduction of modern methods
of manufacture was almost entirely confined to the
European community. The opportunities for gaining
experience were not easy for Indians to come by, and
there was no attempt at technical training for industries
until nearly the end of the century, and then
only on an inadequate scale. The non-existence of
a suitable education to qualify Indians for posts requiring
industrial or technical knowledge was met by
the importation of men from Europe, who supervised
and trained illiterate Indian labor in the mills and
factories that were started. From this class of labor
it was impossible to obtain the higher type of artisan
capable of supervisory work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After pointing out the lamentable deficiency and
comparative failure of the half-hearted measures so
far taken by the Government to provide some kind of
technical education the Commission makes certain
recommendations for meeting the needs of the situation,
which are supplemented by some pertinent
suggestions made by the Honorable Malaviya in his
minority report. The aforesaid summary concludes
with the following paragraph:</p>

<p>&ldquo;To sum up, the Commission finds that India is
a country rich in raw materials and in industrial
possibilities, but poor in manufacturing accomplishments.
The deficiencies in her industrial system are
such as to render her liable to foreign penetration in
time of peace and to serious danger in time of war.
Her labor is inefficient, but for this reason capable of
vast improvement. She relies almost entirely on
foreign sources for foremen and supervisors; and her
intelligentsia have yet to develop the right tradition
of industrialism. Her stores of money lie inert and
idle.<a name="FNanchor_3_36" id="FNanchor_3_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_36" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The necessity of securing the economic safety
of the country and the inability of the people to secure
it without the co-operation and stimulation of Govern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>ment
impose, therefore, on Government policy of
energetic intervention in industrial affairs; and to
discharge the multifarious activities which this policy
demands, Government must be provided with a suitable
industrial equipment in the form of imperial and
provincial departments of Industries.&rdquo;</p>

A BRIEF COMPARATIVE STATEMENT OF THE
PRESENT INDIAN CONSTITUTION, THE MONTAGU-CHELMSFORD
SCHEME OF REFORMS
AND THE CONGRESS-LEAGUE REFORM
PROPOSALS.</h2>


<h3>THE PRESENT CONSTITUTION
OF INDIA</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Under the Government of India
Act, 1915</i> (5 &amp; 6 Geo. 5, c. 61).</p>


<h4>I. <span class="smcap">The Secretary of State
in Council</span></h4>

<p>(1) His Majesty&rsquo;s Secretary of
State for India superintends,
directs, and controls all acts relating
to the government or
revenues of India. He is responsible
to Parliament. He or his
Council has no legislative powers.</p>

<p>(2) The Council of India consists
of 10 to 14 members, appointed
by the Secretary of State for a
term of seven years; and the
majority of Council must sanction
expenditure of revenue and certain
other specified matters. In
practice two of the members have
been Indians since 1907.</p>

<p>(3) The salaries of the Secretary
of State, the Under-Secretaries
and the Office establishment are
paid out of Indian revenues.</p>


<h4>II. <span class="smcap">The Government of India</span></h4>

<p>(1) <i>General.</i>&mdash;The Governor-General
of India is appointed by
the Crown. He has the absolute
power of adopting, suspending or
rejecting measures affecting safety,
tranquillity and interest of India.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Executive Council.</i>&mdash;The Executive
Council consists of five or
six ordinary members appointed
by the Crown generally for five
years, with the Commander-in-chief
as an extraordinary member.
Governor-General in Council is
the supreme autocratic authority
in India in all administrative
matters, and it directly administers
certain Imperial Departments.
One member of Council is now an
Indian.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Legislative Council.</i>&mdash;For
the purpose of legislation the
Council consists of all Executive
members with 60 additional
members, of whom only 27 are
elected by specified electorates
by a method of indirect election.
There is separate representation
for Mohammedans. The Governor-General
is the President of
the Council.</p>

<p>The members of the Legislative
Council can discuss the
Budget, move resolutions or ask
questions, but the Executive Gov<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>ernment
is not bound thereby.
In other words the Legislative
has no control over the purse or
the acts of the Executive.</p>

<p>Every act of the Legislative
requires the assent of the
Governor-General, and the Crown
may also disallow the same.
Besides in cases of emergency
the Governor-General has the
power to promulgate laws in the
shape of ordinances, without reference
to the Legislative Council,
on his own initiative or on the
recommendation of Provincial
Governments. These ordinances
to be in force for six months.</p>


<h3>MONTAGU-CHELMSFORD
SCHEME OF REFORMS</h3>


<h4>I. <span class="smcap">The Secretary of State
in Council</span></h4>

<p>(1) His Majesty&rsquo;s Secretary of
State to be retained, but his
salary to be transferred to British
Estimates.</p>

<p>(2 &amp; 3) A Committee is appointed
to examine and report on the
present constitution of the Council
of India as well as the Office
establishment. (The report of
the Committee is not yet made.)</p>

<p>(4) The House of Commons to
be asked to appoint a Select
Committee for Indian affairs.</p>

<p>(5) Control of Parliament and the
Secretary of State to be modified.</p>


<h4>II. <span class="smcap">The Government of India</span></h4>

<p>(1) <i>General.</i>&mdash;The Government
of India to preserve indisputable
authority on all matters relating
to peace, order, and good Government.
It is to remain fully
autocratic as at present.</p>

<p>A Privy Council to be established
in India.</p>

<p>(2) <i>The Executive Council.</i>&mdash;To
continue as before with maximum
limit removed, but the Indian
element is to be increased to two
members.</p>

<p>Government to be empowered
to appoint a limited number of
members (not necessarily elected)
of the Legislative Council as
Under-Secretaries, similar to Parliamentary
Under-Secretaries in
England.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Legislative Council.</i>&mdash;There
will be two legislative Bodies.
One to be called <i>Legislative Assembly</i>
(with elected majority),
and the other the <i>Council of
State</i> (with official majority).</p>

<p>The Legislative Assembly is to
consist of 100 members, two-thirds
of whom would be elected. Of the
nominated not less than one-third
should be non-officials.
President to be nominated by
the Governor-General.</p>

<p>The Council of State to consist
of 50 members, of whom 21 are
to be elected. The Governor-General
is to be the President.</p>

<p>Bills passed by the Assembly
must also be referred to the
Council of State, the differences,
if any, being settled by a joint
session. But in cases where the
interests of peace, order and good
Government, including sound financial
administration, are concerned,
Governor-General shall
have powers to refer a Bill to the
Council of State and it will become
law in the form approved by the
Council of State even though it
is not acceptable to the Assembly.</p>

<p>Legislative Assembly and the
Council of State may discuss the
Budget, ask questions, and pass<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
resolutions, but they are not
binding on the Executive.</p>

<p>The Governor-General to retain
his power of assenting to Acts and
promulgating ordinances on his
own authority. The Crown may
disallow any Act.</p>

<p>The Montagu-Chelmsford
Scheme proposes periodical (decennial)
Parliamentary inquiries
to revise the constitution, both
for the Central and the Provincial
Governments.</p>


<h3>CONGRESS-LEAGUE REFORM
PROPOSALS</h3>


<h4>I. <span class="smcap">The Secretary of State in
Council</span></h4>

<p>(1) The Secretary of State to be
retained. But his salary to be
transferred to British Estimates.</p>

<p>(2) The Council of India be
abolished.</p>

<p>(3) There should be two permanent
Under-Secretaries, one of
whom should be an Indian. The
charges of the Indian Office establishment
should be transferred to
British Estimates.</p>

<p>(4) The proposed Select Committee
of the House of Commons
is not objected to.</p>

<p>(5) The Secretary of State for
India should eventually occupy
the same position as the Colonial
Secretary. The control of Parliament
and Secretary of State be
modified only with the transfer
of responsibility of the Government
of India to the electorate.</p>


<h4>II. <span class="smcap">The Government of India</span></h4>

<p>(1) <i>General.</i>&mdash;The Government
of India shall have undivided
authority in matters concerning
Peace, Tranquillity and Defence
of the Country; but <i>subject to a
Statutory Declaration</i> of the rights
of the people of India as British
citizens, viz., that all Indians
are equal before law, equally
entitled to a licence to bear arms
and to have the freedom of speech,
writing, and meeting, and also
the freedom of the Press, and that
no one be punished or deprived
of his liberty except by a sentence
of a Court of Justice.</p>

<p>That the principle of Responsible
Government should be applied
to the Central Administration
by dividing the subjects
into (1) reserved (2) transferred.
The reserved subjects to be administered
by Government without
popular control. The reserved
subjects shall be Foreign affairs
(except relations with Colonies,
and Dominions), Army, Navy,
and relations with Indian Ruling
Princes, as well as matters affecting
public peace, tranquillity,
defence of the country subject to
the Declarations of Rights mentioned
above. All other subjects
should be transferred subjects&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
transferred to the popular
control exercised by the enlarged
Legislative Assembly.</p>

<p>There should be no Privy
Council.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Executive Council.</i>&mdash;The Executive
Council shall consist partly
of Ministers, from the Elected
members of tie Legislative Council,
and in charge of the transferred
subjects; and other members
nominated by the Government
in charge of the reserved
subjects. When there are two or
more members in charge of the
reserved subjects, half the number
shall be Indians.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>(3) <i>Legislative Council.</i>&mdash;There
should be no Council of State,
but only one Legislative Assembly
composed of 150 members, four-fifths
of whom should be elected
directly by the people. The
Franchise should be as broad as
possible without distinction of
sex, but with a proportional and
communal representation for Mohammedans
as settled at Lucknow.
The Assembly should have an
elected President. (The Moslem
League does not object to the
Council of State if at least half
the members thereof would be
elected).</p>

<p>The Legislative Assembly should
have the same measure of fiscal
autonomy as Self-Governing Dominions,
and should control the
Budget, excepting the reserved
subjects, the allotment for which
shall be a first charge on the
Revenues. All Bills must be
introduced and passed in the
Assembly.</p>

<p>Provided that in the case of
reserved subjects if the Legislative
Assembly does not pass
measures desired by Government,
the Governor-General in Council
may provide for the same by
regulations. Such regulations will
remain in force for one year, and
shall not be renewed unless 40
per cent (two-fifths of the members)
of the Legislative Assembly
present and voting are in favour
of them.</p>

<p>The Governor-General to retain
his existing power of making
ordinances and the Governor-General
in Council the power
of passing regulations. The Governor-General
and the Crown to
have also power of assent, reservation
or disallowance.</p>

<p>The Congress-League scheme
objects to periodical Commissions
for revising the Constitution, and
asks for a Statutory declaration
that the transfer of responsibility
should be completed in a period
not exceeding 15 years, when
India should be placed on a
footing of equality with the other
self-governing parts of the Empire.</p>


<h4>III. <span class="smcap">The Provincial Governments</span></h4>

<p>(1) <i>General.</i>&mdash;India, including
Burma, is divided into 14 provinces,
each of which has its own
Provincial Government.</p>

<p>By a system of decentralisation,
revenues are allotted to all these
provinces by the Government of
India. The Provincial Governments
administer, under the general
supervision of the Central
Government, without being responsible
to the Local Legislatures
in any way.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Executive.</i>&mdash;Bombay, Bengal,
and Madras have each a Governor
sent from England and three
(one of whom is, in practice, an
Indian) Executive Councillors appointed
by the Crown, with a
Legislative Council.</p>

<p>Bihar and Orissa governed by
a Lieutenant-Governor with Legislative
and Executive Councils;
United Provinces, Punjab and
Burma by a Lieutenant-Governor
with only a Legislative Council;
Central Provinces and Assam by a
Chief Commissioner with only a
Legislative Council, and the remaining
by Chief Commissioners
without any Councils.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Legislative.</i>&mdash;The Provincial
Legislative Councils enjoy limited
powers for legislation in the provinces.
The Governor is the President
of the Council.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>The elected members of the
Legislative Council are elected by
constituencies formed of Municipal
and Local Boards, and Landlords
with a separate constituency for
Mohammedans. They are in a
minority except in Bengal, where
they have at present only a small
majority. The Legislative Councils
have no control over the
Executive or the Budget.</p>

<p>The Acts of the Provincial
Legislature must be assented to
first by the Governor, Lieutenant
Governor, or the Commissioner
as the case may be, and then by
the Governor-General subject always
to disallowance by the
Crown.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Public Services</span></h4>

<p>Recruitment, examination, and
other matters relating to Indian
services are at present under the
control of the Indian Government
and the Secretary of State,
with no statutory limit for recruitment
in India.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Local Self-Government</span></h4>

<p>Half the members of Municipalities
and Local Boards are generally
elected, but the bodies are
under official control.</p>


<h4>III. <span class="smcap">The Provincial Governments</span></h4>

<p>(1) <i>General.</i>&mdash;All Provinces having
Legislative Councils at present
(except Burma) should have a
Governor with Executive and
Legislative Councils. A complete
separation will be made between
Indian and Provincial Revenues.
Provincial Governments are to
have certain powers of taxation
and borrowing.</p>

<p>Responsible Government is to
be introduced in the Provinces by
a division of departments into
reserved (for Government) and
transferred (to popular control)
subject to a revision after five
years. (A Committee is appointed
to settle which subjects should
be transferred. The report is
not yet out.)</p>

<p>(2) <i>The Executive</i> would be a kind
of Diarchy, consisting of the
Governor and two members (one
of whom is to be an Indian)
who will be in charge of the
reserved subjects, and responsible
only to Government; and
a Minister or Ministers, nominated
by the Governor from the
elected members of the Council,
who will be in charge of the
transferred subjects and responsible
not to the Legislature, but
to the electors who may not elect
him next time. There may also
be additional members without
Portfolios for the purpose of
consultation.</p>

<p>Ministers to have no voice
in decisions concerning reserved
subjects or about the supply
for them in the Budget.</p>

<p>There will be Under-Secretaries
and Standing Committees from
the members of the Legislative
Councils to assist the Executive.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Legislative Councils.</i>&mdash;These
would be practically two Provincial
Legislative Bodies: (1) Legislative
Council. (2) Grand
Committee.</p>

<p>The Legislative Council will
have a substantial elected
majority, elected on a broad
franchise with Governor as President.
(A Commission is appointed
to inquire into the question
of franchise and the composition
of the Council, but the report is
not yet out.)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>The Grand Committee will
comprise only from 40 to 50 per
cent of Legislative Council, and
its members will be partly elected
by a ballot and partly appointed
by nomination.</p>

<p>All Legislation and the Budget
for transferred subjects only must
be passed in the Legislative
Councils.</p>

<p>But when the Governor certifies
that a bill dealing with reserved
subjects is essential he may refer
the Bill to the Grand Committee
and have it finally passed there.</p>

<p>The members of the Legislative
Council can ask questions and
pass resolutions, but the latter
are not binding on the Executive,
except resolutions on the Budget
for the transferred subjects.</p>

<p>All Provincial Legislation requires
the assent of the Governor
and the Governor-General, and is
also subject to disallowance by His
Majesty.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Public Service</span></h4>

<p>Racial bars should not exist.
In addition to recruitment in
England a system of appointment
to all public services be
established in India with an increasing
percentage of recruitment.
In the case of Indian
Civil Service the percentage should
be 33 of the superior posts, with
annual increment of 1&frac12; per cent.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Local Self-Government</span></h4>

<p>Complete popular control in
Local Bodies to be established as
far as possible.</p>


<h4>III. <span class="smcap">The Provincial Governments</span></h4>

<p>(1) <i>General.</i>&mdash;There should be a
complete separation of the Provincial
from the Imperial Revenues.
All Provincial Governments should
have certain powers of taxation
and borrowing.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Executive.</i>&mdash;Full responsible
Government should be introduced
into the Provinces. The Executive
will thus consist of the Governor
and Ministers responsible
to the Legislature. There should
be no distinction of transferred or
reserved subjects.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Legislative.</i>&mdash;There should be
only one Legislative Council,
having four-fifths of its members
elected on a broad franchise without
distinction of sex, but with
a proportional and communal
representation for the Mohammedans.
The Legislative Council
should elect its own President,
and must have control over the
Budget. All Bills must be introduced
and passed in this Legislative
Council.</p>

<p>The Governor to retain his
power of assent, and the Governor-General
and the Crown the
power of assent or disallowance.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Public Services</span></h4>

<p>Services should be recruited in
India in a fixed and progressive
proportion. The annual recruitment
in India for the Indian
Civil Service should be 50 per
cent to start with, and that
Indians be granted at least 25
per cent of the Commissions in
Army and the proportion be
gradually increased. There should
be no racial distinctions.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Local Self-Government</span></h4>

<p>Municipal and Local Bodies
should be completely under popular
control.</p>

REPORTS OF COMMITTEES ON FRANCHISES
AND DIVISION OF FUNCTIONS</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>London Times</i> May 13, 1919)</p>


<p>The reports of the two Committees which sat in
India from early in November to the end of February
last to fill out the framework of the Montagu-Chelmsford
Report published last July were issued last night.</p>

<p>The Franchise Committee, of which Lord Southborough
was chairman, recommend a scheme of
territorial constituencies, urban and rural, the latter
based on the existing land revenue districts, together
with communal representation for Mohammedans and
Sikhs (as contemplated in the original scheme) and
for Indian Christians, Europeans, and Anglo-Indians:
and the representation of special interests, including
commerce and industry.</p>

<p>The other Committee, of which Mr. R. Feetham
was chairman, make detailed recommendations as to
the division of functions between the Government of
India and the provincial Governments, and also
between &ldquo;reserved&rdquo; and &ldquo;transferred&rdquo; subjects in
the provinces. Proposals are made for the modification
in some important respects (notably in the
powers conferred on the Governor) of the &ldquo;diarchial&rdquo;
system in the provinces set forth in what is conveniently
called the &ldquo;Joint Report.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>As was indicated in <i>The Times</i> on April 5, Lord Southborough&rsquo;s
Committee have not accepted the appeals addressed to them in the
interest of woman suffrage. They found it advocated &ldquo;rather
on general grounds than on considerations of practicability.&rdquo; They
are satisfied that the social conditions of India would make such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
a step now premature. They are of opinion, however, that at the
revision of the constitutions of the councils proposed in the Joint
Report 10 years after their reconstitution the matter should be
reconsidered in the light of the experience gained and of social conditions
as they then exist.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Franchise Qualifications</span></h4>

<p>The general proposals for the franchise are based upon the principle
of residence and the possession of certain property qualifications.
In addition the enfranchisement of all retired and pensioned officers
of the Indian Army, whether of commissioned or non-commissioned
rank, is recommended. This step was universally and strongly
recommended in the Punjab, and it is to extend to all provinces.
The property qualification is adapted to local conditions and is
guided by the principle that the franchise should be as broad as
possible, consistently with the avoidance of any such inordinate
extension as might lead to a breakdown of the machinery of election
through weight of numbers. The large proportion of illiterate
voters, in the absence of a literary test, may cause difficulty, but it
has already been faced successfully in municipal elections in India
by the use of coloured ballot-boxes and other like devices.</p>

<p>No rigid uniformity of property qualification has been sought,
but the committee have proposed the same qualification for all
communities within the same area. A substantially higher proportion
of the urban than of the rural population will be enfranchised.
At present the total number of electors for the provincial councils
is 33,007, and of these no fewer than 17,448 are Mohammedans, since
that community enjoys direct representation on an individual
basis. The number of voters will be raised under the scheme to
5,179,000, being 2.34 per cent of the total population in the eight
provinces, which is nearly 220,000,000.</p>

<p>The long established administrative unit of the &ldquo;district&rdquo; is made
the territorial area for constituencies but the relatively few cities
with large populations are to be separately represented. Occasionally
towns are grouped into separate urban constituencies.
Single-member constituencies are the general rule, but latitude is
left to the local Governments. Plural voting is to be forbidden,
but this does not apply to electors in constituencies formed for the
representation of special interests.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Special Communities</span></h4>

<p>In conformity with the recognition of the Joint Report that
separate Mohammedan representation cannot be abandoned, the
scheme provides for Mohammedan constituencies. The compact of
the joint session of the National Congress and the Moslem League
at Lucknow in December, 1916, is accepted as a guide in allocating
the proportion of Mohammedan seats. In the Punjab this facility
is to be extended to the Sikhs. Beyond this the framers of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
Joint Report did not propose to go; but Lord Southborough&rsquo;s
Committee recommend separate electorates, where the numbers
justify that course, for Indian Christians, Europeans, and the
domiciled &ldquo;Anglo-Indians&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, country-born Europeans and
Eurasians. It is observed that candidates belonging to these
communities would have no chance of being elected by general
constituencies. The hope is expressed that it will be possible &ldquo;at
no very distant date to merge all communities into one general
electorate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Other claims for separate electorates are not conceded. Regret
is expressed that the organized non-Brahmans of the Madras Presidency
refuse to appear before the Committee. It is pointed out that
there the non-Brahmans (omitting the depressed or &ldquo;untouchable&rdquo;
classes) outnumber the Brahmans by about 22 to one; and on the
basis of enfranchisement taken in Madras the non-Brahmans would
be in the proportion of four to one. It is held to be unreasonable
to adopt the proposed expedient for a community which has an
overwhelming electoral strength.</p>

<p>The alternative of reserving a considerable number of seats for
non-Brahmans in plural member constituencies did not commend
itself to a section of the non-Brahmans, though evidence went to
show that such a proposal might be accepted by the Brahmans
&ldquo;if it were the price of an enduring peace.&rdquo; It is suggested that his
Majesty&rsquo;s Government might afford the parties to the controversy
an opportunity, before the electoral machinery for the Presidency
is completed, of agreeing upon some solution&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, the provision
of plural member constituencies and of a certain proportion of
guaranteed non-Brahman seats.</p>

<p>The separate representation of zamindars and landholders granted
under the Morley-Minto scheme is extended and provision made for
university seats. The election by accredited bodies of representatives
of commerce and industry is also continued and amplified. There is
to be nomination for the representation of the &ldquo;depressed classes,&rdquo;
for in no case was it found possible to provide an electorate on any
satisfactory system of franchise. Labour is to be represented by
nomination where the industrial conditions seem likely to give rise
to labour problems. The majority of the Committee are of opinion
that dismissal from Government service should constitute a bar to
candidature if it has taken place in circumstances which, in the
opinion of the Governor in Council, involve moral turpitude; but
Lord Southborough, Mr. S. N. Bannerjea, and Mr. Sastri dissent,
considering it improper to limit the choice of the electorate by a
disqualification based on the decision of an executive authority.</p>

<p>The size of the Provincial Legislatures will vary from 53 in Assam
to 125 in Bengal. The eight Councils will comprise 796 members,
made up as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
Elected by general constituencies, 308.<br />
By communities, 185.<br />
By landholders, 35.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>By universities, 8.<br />
By commercial, industrial, and planting interests, 45.<br />
The nominated representatives will number 47, and the officials, 128.<br />
</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The &ldquo;All-India&rdquo; Body</span></h4>

<p>For the Indian Legislative Assembly, the Committee propose
80 elected members, instead of the 68 suggested in the Joint Report.
Fourteen representatives appointed by nomination and 26 officials
(including seven <i>ex-officio</i> members) will bring up the total, exclusive
of the Governor-General, to 120, as compared with 68 at present.
A statement of the manifold difficulties in the way of direct election
for this All-India body leads to the conclusion that there must be
indirect election for all general and communal seats by the members
of the Provincial Legislatures. &ldquo;We trust that, in progress of time,
a growing sense of political organization will enable indirect election
to be superseded by some direct method.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A scheme for the creation of the &ldquo;Council of State&rdquo; on the lines
of the Joint Report is set forth, on the basis of election thereto by
non-official members of the Provincial Councils. There would be
24 elected and 32 <i>ex-officio</i> or nominated members, exclusive of the
Governor-General. The electors should be left free to choose any
person qualified to be a member of a Provincial Legislature.</p></div>


<h2>THE DIVISION OF FUNCTIONS</h2>

<p>The first duty of Mr. Feetham&rsquo;s Committee was to
consider what were the services to be appropriated to the
provinces, all others remaining with the Government of
India. The Committee proceeded on the basis that there
is to be no such statutory demarcation of powers as to
leave the validity of Acts passed to be challenged in the
Courts. In other words, no alteration is proposed in
the system under which the All-India Legislature as
regards British India, and each of the Provincial
Legislatures as regards its own province, have in
theory concurrent jurisdiction over the whole legislative
field.</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>In framing the lists the Committee have treated as All-India
subjects certain large general heads, such, for instance, as commerce
and laws regarding property, but have taken out of these and allotted
to the provinces important sections&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, in the case of the first
Excise, and in the case of the second laws regarding land tenure.
Any matter included in the provincial list is to be deemed to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
excluded from any All-India subject of which otherwise it would
form part. Subjects not expressly included in either list are regarded
as All-India subjects, but the Governor-General in Council
may add to the provincial list &ldquo;matters of merely local or private
interest within the province.&rdquo; It is claimed that the scheme has
been devised on such a basis as to leave the way open for the process
of development.</p>

<p>The list of subjects to be transferred to Indian Ministers is on
the whole more extensive than the suggested list attached to the
Joint Report. With certain reservations University education is
to be transferred, as well as primary, secondary, and technical, on
the ground that the educational system must be regarded as an
organic whole. But European and Anglo-Indian education, which
is organized on a separate basis is excluded from the transfer.</p>

<p>The decision of the functions of the Provincial Government,
popularly known as diarchy, has been criticized as likely to lead to
friction, and sometimes to deadlock. To mitigate these difficulties,
the Committee propose important changes in the relations of the
Governor with both sections of the Government. It is to be the
duty of the Governor in Council in the case of reserved departments,
and of the Governor and Ministers in the case of transferred departments,
to take care that the administration is so conducted as not
to prejudice or occasion undue interference with the working of any
department falling in the other category. The Governor has to
decide whether a particular matter falls within the scope of a reserved
or a transferred department, and to take care that any order
given by the Governor-General in Council is complied with by the
department concerned.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Governor&rsquo;s Increased Powers</span></h4>

<p>In the case of disagreement between the Executive Council and
Ministers as to action which appears to the Governor to affect both
a reserved and a transferred department, the Governor is to give
such decision as the interests of good government may seem to
require, provided that, in so far as circumstances admit, before such
decision is given the matter should be considered by both sections
of the Government sitting together. If the Minister remains
obdurate, it will be for the Governor to dismiss and find another
Minister.</p>

<p>If, owing to a vacancy, there is no Minister in charge of a transferred
department, the Governor will certify that such emergency
exists and that immediate action is necessary. On such certificate
being given, the Governor in Council will have authority to take
action, subject to the obligation of reporting to the Governor-General
in Council. In other words there will be re-entry for a temporary
and limited purpose during an interregnum. This is a considerable
departure from the proposal of the Joint Report that Ministers shall
hold office for the lifetime of the Legislative Council. The power
of the Governor to dismiss a Minister, says the report, &ldquo;seems<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
essential if deadlocks are to be avoided.&rdquo; The over-ruling of a
minister will depend in the last resort on the Governor&rsquo;s personal
judgment of the situation.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Finance</span></h4>

<p>The Committee felt themselves precluded from considering any
modification of the proposals of the Joint Report for the separation
of the finances of the Government of India and of Provincial Governments.
No opinion is expressed on memoranda received at a late
stage from Sir James Meston making proposals for substantial departure
from the plan of dealing with provincial finance set forth
in the Joint Report.</p>

<p>It may be recalled that Mr. Montagu and Lord Chelmsford proposed
that, if the residue of the provincial revenues is not sufficient,
it should be open to Ministers to suggest fresh taxation. The
Committee take the view that when any new provincial tax or any
proposed addition to an existing tax requires legislation to give effect
to it, the decision whether that legislation should be undertaken
must rest with the Governor and Ministers. Since the whole balance
of the revenues of the province will be at the disposal of the Ministers
for the administration of the transferred departments, the Committee
consider that when an existing tax cannot be reduced or remitted
without legislation, the decision whether legislation should be undertaken
must also rest with the Governor and Ministers. To that
extent taxation for provincial purposes should be regarded as a
transferred subject.</p>

<p>The assessment or collection of the tax would be reserved or
transferred, according as the agency employed belonged to a reserved
or to a transferred department. The view is also taken
that, when alterations in taxation can be effected without any change
in the law, the decision whether any alteration should in fact be made
must be recognized as resting with the Governor in Council if the
department is reserved, and with the Governor and Ministers if
it is transferred.</p>

<p>In respect to the powers of borrowing on the sole credit of provincial
revenues which are to be conferred, the Committee propose
that, if after joint deliberation there is a difference of opinion between
the Executive Council and the Ministers, the final decision
whether a loan should be raised and as to the amount of the loan
must rest with the Governor.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Public Services</span></h4>

<p>Detailed proposals are made in relation to the public services,
to be classified as Indian (All-India), provincial and subordinate,
No service is to be included in the first of these categories without
the sanction of the Secretary of State, while the demarcation between
the provincial and subordinate services is to be left to the
provincial Governments.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>General approval is given to a scheme prepared by the Government
of India providing that legislation should be undertaken in
Parliament to declare the tenure and provide for the classification
of the public service. It should secure the pensions of the All-India
services, and should empower the Secretary of State to make
rules for their conduct and rights and liabilities, and to fix their
pay and regulate their allowances. Similar legislation should be
passed by the Government of India in respect to the provincial
services, and to empower the provincial Governments to make rules
for the subordinate services. The Committee does not express any
opinion on the proposal of the Government of India to set up a
statutory Public Service Commission on lines somewhat wider than
those of the Civil Commission in Great Britain.</p>

<p>Among the clauses suggested for insertion in the instructions for
each provincial Governor is one enjoining him to &ldquo;protect all members
of the public services in the legitimate exercise of their functions
and enjoyment of all recognized rights and privileges.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The instructions are to charge him with the duty of safeguarding
the legitimate interests of the Anglo-Indian or domiciled community,
and &ldquo;to take care that no change in educational policy, affecting
adversely Government assistance afforded to existing institutions
maintained or controlled by religious bodies, is adopted without due
consideration.&rdquo; The Governor is also to be instructed that he &ldquo;shall
not sanction the grant of monopolies or special privileges to private
undertakings which are inconsistent with the public interest, nor
shall he permit any unfair discrimination in matters affecting commercial
or industrial interests.&rdquo;</p></div>
